There are LOADS of cats and you can mix them up, so you get really funny goofy looking ones like a zombie-rockstar cat or a robot-princess cat. And all the little homes are really cute too. Looks lovely and lots of fun!

Really great game.. So much fun... But way too much $ on in app purchases. Sad. Really rigged to make you want to spend!
I like all the differnt cat breads even if there are hybreads

I really like this game. It's super addicting and all the cats are adorable in this game. I just hate the fact that it's so expensive to get rid of the rocks :(
Such a cute game my five year old and I both enjoy it!
So adorable love it
I love the cats on this game
Need to be more exciting it is boring hav mini games
This is a game
It's a fun game, worth playing and collecting the different breeds
This game is awesome I luv it!!! I used to hate cats until I played this game
Great game
I'll admit, I do it for the 'nip! Haha. Passes time, and makes cat meows. What more could you ask for?
:O OMG KITTIES!!
"This game is amazing<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00B8>

This game is addicting but their needs to be more to it. The play pen should have more then one game for instance.
I LOVE THIS APP please make more breeds this is the best game ever. Hope there's a cat tap fever2
"My 7year
 old girl loves cats and loves this game even more! It's awesome!!!"
I love this game,it is so fun,all though it could improve a little bit but for the most part it's good.Once again I love this game!
Fun and addicting
I love this game! You can buy multiple love shacks so you don't have to always wait for the cats to finish their business. You also get catnip easily. So I rate this a good 5 stars! Keep up the good work!
I LOVE IT<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00BB><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00BB><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00BB><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00BB><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00BB><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00B8>
I love playing this game I wish that there was a dog game like this
S'cute!
Fun
My kids love it. They are 7 years old and they don't stop playing it.
This is the best game ever :D
I like the cats wish it was a bit easier to get things.
I searched for a cat game and this was one of the first ones to pop up but it gives to many notifications
Love it!
I love all my adorable cats!!!!
I love this game it's so scute.
It never leaves you with nothing to do like most of the other games that are like this.
I love this game so much it's the best cat came on the App Store by far!!

Yes
Cute kittens and cats. Fun mini-games, and cool new species this is a must buy app!
It's so addicting! I just can't put it down!
This game is amazing but to break the rock and fish bone it's to expensive.
This game is quite a bit more fun than I thought it would be.
This game is fun and I like breeding the cats and seeing what I'll get out of it!! Not a bad game if I do say so myself. Also, my 8 year old sister downloaded it after she saw me playing!! Haha
I love this game. It's really fun, but sometimes, I try to play in the play pen and it crashes. I've found a way to get around that, but I'd rather not have to worry about that in the first place. Besides that, this cute little game rocks!!! <f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+0080> <U+2665> <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00BA>
The cats are super cute and the game is really entertaining and fun while still being challenging.
I love this game not boring and too cute!
This hame looked so cute and when i played it I nearly exploded of cutness OMG I LOVE THIS GAME<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00BA><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00B8><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00BB>
I started playing this game forever ago, and I think it's fun. The kittens are so cute, the tutorial is super easy, and it isn't hard to keep up on. All in all, it's easy to get into the game at the beginning.
Really fun
Love,love,love!!!
This game is so much fun
It's positively adorable and completely addicting! Love it
This is the best game ever!!!!! I just got it and can't wait to beat it! I'm actually started to breed hybrids and there are weird results. Can't wait it get back playing!
Perfect for not being able to own a cat for real <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00B9>
I love that you can breed cats. This is the best game ever!!
This game is so amazing I love how the hybrids are combo of both parents traits and there is are endless possibilities for all your hybrid needs
The game is pretty fun! And the best part is... The game doesn't need internet! <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0084>
I love this game! So addicting! I just love the fact that they make up new cats like: Princess Cat, Anime Cat, and even Ninja Cat!
Fun
Omg I love this game so much I'm on it pretty much all the time. If I had to choose what game was the most fun on my I pad I would say cat tap fever. In fact I think it's the most fun game in the whole entire world. It's just purr-fect!!!!!!!!!
I love the sound and pictures, as well as mixing breeds, just wish level was not capped at 30
A++++++++++++*
Really fun game. Wish there was a cheat app
Love making babies with different kind of pets.
Awesome game
It's so awesome and cute and fun and I love that they included my FAVV goddess Bast! She is goddess of cats and kittens. And I was overjoyed about the anime! So cuuuuute! You can even make grumpy cat memes.
Fun little game.    It's i good time killer
This game is cute
Awesome game!!!!
"Cute and fun.  I love that each breed has it's own action/movement & meows.  I enjoy creating the Hybrids.  So many amazing combinations. <f0><U+009F><U+0090><U+00B1><f0><U+009F><U+0090><U+00B1><f0><U+009F><U+0090><U+00B1><f0><U+009F><U+0090><U+00B1><f0><U+009F><U+0090><U+00B1><U+2764><U+2764><U+2764><U+2764><U+2764>

I am kitty549
It needs to b less gems to destroy the small rocks
I love how easy this game is :)
Love this game
The game is great, it has a decent concept and cool characters and ideas. The only complaint I have is that sometimes is freezes up and has to completely restart.
Cute game!! Wish there were more cats to mate and find!
Nice little game. Very entertaining!
I like this game it fun
It would be more fun if it wasn't that hard to get new breeds....
Very fun. So cat
This game is the best! <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00BB>
Good
It's cute, fun, time consuming
I don't even like cats but this game is fun.
Keeps getting better!
I'm loving this game more and more the more I play it. So cute! I love discovering new breeds and the awesome habitats. Nothing is outrageously priced and does NOT pressure you to make in app purchases which is great!! Loving it!
I like this game
so cute! love it
The game is very cute & fun. A couple of bugs though when tapping on the cats. It's a relaxing though.
Nice little time waster. Needs more pure breeds and objectives.  Too many duplicate outcomes.
Hippie cat and in-bread cat shouldn't have drug references
Love this game can't live without it.
A cute, fun app!! It's a little addictive but that's ok!
I love this game. I love all the different types of cats!
This game is awesome. I love breeding all sorts of cats, I love hearing their different meows while collecting their gems, and I just love the fact that this game is all cats, cats, cats! My only complaints would be LAG and 2 times since I've started playing I got "invisible" prizes from the present.
My kids love this game. There are many levels and periodic updates.
Cutest game ever!
I love the new update!
Sooooooo cute game I love it! <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0086>
there is a glitch with the matchmaker goal where I have over eight breeds but it won't complete.
I love this game! I acually like breeding the hybrids cause they r mixes of the parents. It is like playing with genetics. You should make more islands so I can keep breeding the hybrids. I also love how easy it is to get catnip. I love this game a lot! :D
This game won't load up fast enough to get the game started. Please make the game load up faster!! Thanks
Needs wifi to play ... Was enjoying it till my wifi cut off and a error message popped up ... Wifi only .. :(
It's pawsome!!!
The humor is fantastic and subtly reminds me of my digipet from 15 years ago. Love it.
What is this I don't even...
Super cute game recomend to children
Yeah it's got me hooked that's for sure
I love this game the cats are so cute
This game is awsome you should make a dog tap fever.
This game is just awesome, it's so much fun to play and also so cute >.<

If you like breeding games you'll love this one :)
I downloaded it and it spams with adds so not download
Wonderful game with a lot fun challenge
I love to make things with paper
To have a better experience the game you will need more players but so far I am pleased to say I am enjoying the game
Really good could use a couple of other players
Doesn't load past the start up screen
Need to have the ability to manage coalition better i.e kick members or promote thm etc. coalition chat is good but could do with bein able to write longer sentences. In general higher levels for buildings like parade grounds, research lab, special weapons etc, training could also do with higher levels
Brilliant game
I think this game is awesome!!
I got nearly a who's file file of clones and I play them and I play all of them shame on the clons.well I'm gona play it and in gona do it lag it so yea I'm stoking with it
This game has potential, but be warned, there are a lot of bugs, they manage to take your money ( the bugs never affect that bit!!) but do not expect any after sales care - after about 5 weeks of play a good few ££ spent - I am deleting before they take any more money!!!
Great game but we're has all my buildings and everything gone  help I want everything back else just delete the app .
Inferior clash of clans clone.
I love this game! Really enjoying it so far and having fun building my army. Looking forward to spending more hours on this. Really give this a go!
It's a good game, I purchased some diamonds/credits only to have them disappear. I have been told by support there's nothing they can do.
It was an alright game until a minor update for bug fixes came out. I updated it and now whenever i play on it then go off the game then go back on it the progress i have done has been lost and the game resets its self.
This game started out good. There were a lot of issues with it but it was cute and fun to play. The recent update has made this game unplayable. Buildings will not upgrade and fights kick you out for no reason. There seems to be no support or care by the programmers and if anything things are getting worse.  Put it this way, you know things are bad when your Facebook page has a grand total of 14 likes... I've pretty much gave up now, such a shame.
Everything itspants says below is true plus the walls are a bit expensive and don't provide enough protection against mortar troops. I just hope the latest update sorts these problems out otherwise it's a good clone of clash of clans.
Btw when do u unlock coalition
Same as the rest don't work once you have built landing pad
Same as others get to build landing pad and it does not think you have built it can this be fixed looked like a good game
Crashed out after starting the troop landing pad mission. Now it tells me I need to build the landing I've already built and won't let me build another or do anything else
Absolutely brilliant game, well worth a download!!!!
Initially looked good. But game stuck telling me I need a troop landing pad when I already have one. I have deleted.......
"Save your time and money. Once you get past a certain level you can't compete unless you spend money. Also, at some point the game will fail to load and nothing you or the programmers can do to get it back...start from scratch!  Many glitches as well. Every attack is listed as some from your own alliance even though they aren't.

***update starting a class action lawsuit against the owners and programmers. Was never returned money spent in game for gems bought and used to upgrade my troops. The troops were leveling from 4 to 5. When I logged on two weeks later to check if any email I see the troops are now level 3!  They take your cash then give nothing in return. They are crooks and don't answer correspondence. So I hope the suit against them will show some results."
Good game just to keep one busy
This game is really fun when working.  Unfortunately, it goes down once every couple of weeks.  Still giving a good rating based on when the games is working properly.
Little choppy but excellent game....get in now before the super rich in-app purchasers make it impossible
Nice change from other similar games. The set up seems quick but seems fair enough to take time to not get ahead of yourself.
Better than clash of clans
It's a great addicting game similar to CoC but different enough to be enjoyable my only problem is the touch sensor is a little off sometimes
Love the latest update -chat feature and clan rewards are great.. Finally a strategy game worth playing.
This game is really fun! You can attack whoever you want and really fun game play!
Lots better since the update.  Very stable and no log on issues. Fun, interactive game
Great game, fun to play, but for the past week it hasn't worked. Just keeps saying its offline and to play the training missions. The developers need to get this fixed ASAP.
I've been playing this game for about 3 wks now and after making a purchase to get more gems to just get ahead of my friend we both can NOT get online anymore with it! I have tried calling the company to report the problem but they gave me an email address and didn't get any where so I deleted the game and reinstalled it but lost everything and 2 days later it started to work again but less then 2 wks later it back to square one NOT working!!!! I'm sooooooo done! If I can only get my money back so I can give it to a homeless guy on the street that could use it! It junk!!
This is the worst app I've ever downloaded. Half the time it does work or has bugs that doesn't allow it to use all features. DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT !!! You will regret it! Customer service is a joke and no help. I repeat DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP !!!
So I play for a while have a great time almost spent some money but thank goodness I didn't. After a few weeks of playing the game doesn't connect anymore.  It says I need an internet connect.  Problem is I have one ... I have tried several different wifi connections and just my phone connection.  Tried uninstalling and reinstalling no go.  Hit up support and they did respond but do you really want to wait a week (and they haven't fixed the issue) before you can play again?
the game has been offline for about four days now. always something wrong with their servers. dont waste your time. play something else
I think this game could have potential but now it won't connect, it says im in offline mode even though I have a good connection. Some collectors also don't collect when you leave. I think Clash of Clans is a better game.
This game started out AWESOME! However, once I had spent about $20 on in-app purchases, my base was MIA! I had to start over from scratch. I feel that I am entitled to a refund! DO NOT WASTE MONEY ON IN-APP PURCHASES!
My base has been under attack for the past 4 days and I don't like how it has no sound or music.
It's a great game when it loads. I have been unable to load the game for three days. It constantly says I'm under attack. If this issue gets resolved, I will play more. Until then, I am playing clash of clans and samurai siege.
Server issues for the past 4 days. Keeps saying I'm under attack. E-mailed 505 but no response yet. When it works its GREAT! I like it more then clash of clans
It is a very fun game, but now it says i am under attack every time i log on, i can only play in offline mode now...fix this to get ur 5 stars back
I have had to restart this game after my game was lost randomly and now I just lost all my resources randomly after doing 1 campaign mission. Full storages, flipped to campaign for 1 mission. Reloaded base and bam ZERO resources. Wanted to like the game, but it's simply not stable or reliable.
I liked the game but 3 days ago my base has been under attack and it's always under attack I can't even see my base or do anything. Whenever I open the application it's days my base is under attack, always!
It's a fun game when it works but there are so many issues that I'm not going to explain because it would end up being a book. I've given up on this game and finally deleted
The game is fun to pay, but have to deal with daily software issue of building level upgrades, and then exiting for that session to discover that none of your upgrades are continuing to build but the cost of them is still gone.  It's a daily issue and not a internet connection issue because I have gig connection within my house. Because of it I find myself playing other games like it more (clash of clans)
This game is so fun, it's similar to clash of clans in gameplay, but I enjoy it much more!
Great game
Now, may of you may not know this, but this game is new. I like its Clash of Clans feel to it. Nice work
I started playing it and I have not quit playing, I have not found any bugs or glitches,so keep up the good work!
If you like clash of clans you will like this game. Fun strategy game. Very challenging and keep you going for hours
Great game!!
Something to occupy some time. Easy to do.  Same game as Clash of Clans
Fun
It's dumb you can't play it i want a update fix it!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Don't no if yall play battle islands but I like it
It's fun
Great game keep it up
Game is much better! Good update!
It looks cool it just won't let me past the tutorial. Rate 5 when it is fixed
I logged in to the game today to find almost all of my progress lost. No upgraded buildings or troops or defenses left. Just a couple basic buildings. I paid real money for upgrades to get to where I was in the game, so I feel as I've been robbed.
Way too many unfixed bugs.
"I got attacked 5 times in 20 minutes by the same person...  C'mon now...
UPDATE:  I'm so lucky!  I just got creamed by the 3rd highest player in the game Johnn!  Really cool, you tool,  you're only like, 50 levels higher than I am!"
Ever since I upgraded I keep losing all my progress please help
Some cheaters were left behind. The missiles that can destroy a whole base are way overpowered and matchmaking is horrible. I get attacked by people with bases way higher than mine. At least 3 levels higher.
Support for  save our save data  if we reinstall the game we dont wanna loose all our progres pleaseupdating hope we can save all our progrese n not loose our gems :/  thank for the update
I can't pass lv1n order troops take forever to loading
I love this game...i have played coc but it is also attractive n fun...but the server is too slow...the game always get crash when i want recon other player or view base...logging in to game is slow too...playing multiplayer is very slow too n sometimes it become crash ....please fix the server...it would be nice if everything is fast.
This game is slow.END OF STORY!
After today's update every time I get on the game it resets what I have done when I was on last
Guys, can't build something I already have. Stuck in the first 3 mins of gameplay. Please fix.
"In tutorial mode, when u told to buy engineer hut, i cant buy it <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0093><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0093><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0093><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0093><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0093><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0093><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0093><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0093>

So how do i continue playing?"
U don't need diamonds I cut down a thousand trees with 0 diamonds
In the tutorial how can I buy an engineer shack with no gems!!!!!, freaking crazy!!!!! U_U
Not even 5 minutes later I get stuck where it wants me to build something I already have.
This game is great just fix a bit of lag and this game will have potential <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0080>
Now it's so laggy and slow you can't do anything.
This game is clone from Clash of clan.
It has potential but needs fixed!
HOW COULD YOU COPY CLASH OF CLAN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,!,!
... the slow connectivity is terrible! Don't get me wrong, the game is good but this is really annoying. Plus there are no alliance chat so what is the point of those alliance!?
"The new update made it WORSE!
Keeps crashing, which is so annoying if I'm upgrading, because it stops upgrading, but keeps my money I spent on upgrading it. It crashes all the time. It's impossible to do a battle, it always crashes when I finish it. It never keeps data of when I played, so I have to re-do everything.

This is frustrating, it looked like a fun game. Plus I would have probably spent money.

I am deleting this app."
"Its fun, its cool looking but you need to fix way to much for it to be a long standing game. I build, come back and its reset so need to re build same thing. Can't search attacks that well and then when I do it doesn't tell me how much resource is available. 
Can be 5 star game if you do."
The latest update doesn't save any data when you close it
In theory this should be worth a play but you can never find targets, the game freezes, all your coin/energy suddenly disappear, and so much more.  Nothing good to say at all.  If you are looking for a clash of clans substitute this is definitely not one.
"No wonder theres no reviews, doesnt even load up. 
Pity as it could be like clash of clans."
Nothing like the musical. Typical game like Candy Crush, Frozen etc. annoyingly addictive.
"Brilliant game love it but 2 big problem for me 
1. Needs an update keeps crashing and freezing on me 
2. Finished chapter 2 and can't go past 2nd gate as none of my friends play this game should have a day timer on it for people who don't play with Facebook or people like me who's not got a big friends list of game players 

That's why I put 4 stars not 5 if they fix this then it would b 5 starts all the way sad now as I can't play anymore"
Why has this game crashed n i can no longer get on it,will it b rectified
A game that resembles the musical and great for strategy!
Fab strategy game. Can be slow on occasion.
Just crashes after update. Can't play now
Looks Like it has Potential..But switches It Self Off And Takes you to Hone Screen after Each level
Nice little game. Enjoyed playing it. Not many levels at the minute.
Love the Game just hate how long it takes to get new levels added... I'm waiting at 110 patiently <f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008D>
"Game has a few issues. I am playing on iPhone 5s the game is very slow. 
I have also started watching the stars u need to collect to get rewards and have found that they don't allow u to go above 5 stars after u pass through the first door. The game is good on the story line but think they really need to sort out the issues. Shame was looking forward to playing the rest of the game"
Got to the first door and now it keeps crashing I am play on a iPad 2 and have latest iOS update
This game is so addictive,glad they brought out a game of wicked as the musical is absolutely amazing
I have spent ages pressing the connect button and nothing happens. I emailed support and they asked what I was playing on, I told them and haven't heard anything since. Not impressed.
I've loved this game as it reminds me of the 4 elements game that I've had to download from online, but with brilliant music and a great story that I already know. Lots of fun very addictive and lots of rewards available too!
Great app but freeZes  occasionally
This game is the best!
Looks like a really good game, but it keeps crashing at the loading stage :(
Like the game but having problems with it dropping off line and up loading.
Loved this on my cruise around the Med
Very addictive but it keeps 'kicking me off'. Would be nice to actually play the game properly
Finding this better than Candy Crush. Strangely addicting. Can't stop playing, I just need more people to play it so I can unlock the doors.
Good way to pass the time
I love this game so addictive but the new update keeps crashing on my ipad
Enjoying playing this game.
"No way forward without paying or finding friends to play it.  Mentions finding keys but that doesn't seem relevant to getting to next level.  I'm not paying so I guess will be uninstalling.  Cos it looks like this is going to happen at every change of level :(. Shame.
Also, why no backing music that is from the show, it's just boring bland sounds."
Brilliant game and very addictive
"Overall this game is ok. As a avid wicked fan, I thought that it would have a least a backing track from the show or a song in the menu. But no. It is just some melody that has no relation to the musical what so ever. Another thing. The game is really slow. After each level it takes a minuet to load up the next one. One good thing is the characters, graphics, the idea of following the show plot and the idea of following the map. 

Not what I expected but it is good enough."
Game worked great until level 64 when it keeps requesting to connect to Facebook. However, never having Facebook it's impossible for me to continue. I've spent money on this game and now I'm very disappointed it's not working.
Loving this. Playing on an iPad and Facebook and like how i can play the game on either and it knows where I am. Love how the levels are getting more difficult too - started off easy but now really having to think about it. More levels please!
After completing up to level 64, I now cannot poss it with there being some "assets" that need to be down loaded - I have facebook but even after trying to update it still doesn't work - otherwise brilliant game
Every time I start this game, it keeps crashing. Please fix it.
This is a great game but it keeps crashing please fix it !!!
Great game, or would be if it would let me see my messages, keeps coming up blank despite saying there are messages, how am I supposed to get my keys if this keeps happening, might just have to bite the bullet and delete the app
Please please please, fix the bugs in this game, it freezes too often and fails to respond to purchases. Other than that a fantastic game that has me occupied. I completed levels 1 to 19 in the first night ( sad I know) lol! <f0><U+009F><U+0099><U+0088>
Doesn't work on ipad mini and freezes all the time and none of the 'shortcut buttons' work on any of my devices
Brilliant game, the option to connect to FB doesn't work, please fix!! More levels needed!!
I love this game! I am a dedicated Wicked fan but I don't know how to get keys to pass the gates. I am stuck at level 18 and cannot get through the first gate. I have been stuck for months and I don't know what to do... Help!
If the game didn't continuously freeze and crash then it would be great. Every time it freezes and struggles to load I loose a life therefore never being able to play. It doesn't load messages.
Needs some major bug fixes runs so slow on the iPhone 4S, nearly unplayable :-((
I downloaded to IPad and it does not even open, please fix I would really like to try it out
I love this game, and have enjoyed playing it on Facebook, however, when I downloaded the app to play on my iPad, the app won't open! Very disappointed at this.
I have enjoyed playin this game but got to level 18 n Carnt move on as need keys but Carnt get any as I won't work :( xx
The game itself is good, however, I have been unable to play in over 3 months, because I am stuck at a gate and only one person will send me a key. I refuse to pay any money to unlock a gate. There is only a handful of my friends playing, and they have probably given up too, because they are also stuck at a gate. This would be much better if the gates would unlock automatically after a few days if no one sends keys or you do not want to pay to unlock it. I will be deleting it.
The gameplay is very fun. However, like most games like this you will hit a point where it's nearly impossible to proceed without spending money. The levels get difficult to the point that you either give up or spend some cash. I played it and enjoyed it but the in app purchases are a bit high, so I'm deleting it.
This one of the best match three games I've played. I'm getting addicted to it
Amazing game but after every level it leaves the game and logs onto Facebook, then you have to wait for everything to reload to play one level and have the same thing happen again. If this was fixed I would give full stars.
Hey I like this game I've actually been playing it on FB on my computer and I downloaded the game for my iPhone but everytime I try to connect it to my FB account it keeps saying I've done it when I haven't so I just thought it was glitch in the game other then that love the game!
This game was fun at the very beginning then at level 7 it will not let you win.
Love this game!!!
Only problem is that no one plays this game. So, you can't get any keys to go to the next land. No matter how many invites one sends no one wants to play. So, once you get to level 36, you will never play again and eventually delete the game. Notice there are not many reviews. This game should allow people to get keys from other people who play this game that may not be your Facebook friend. I think that is the only way they will get anyone to keep playing this game. I'm almost at level 36. Once I get there I will probably delete because I will be unable to obtain any keys to keep moving forward in this game.
I am really enjoying this game. I have played a lot of similar games and usually got bored or frustrated before long. This game is unique because of the type of strategy involved - following a map toward a specific goal by paving a path by matching 3 or more of the same item (like Candy Crush in this way).  I love love love Wicked & listening to the soundtrack of the original Broadway cast.  I regret that I didn't see it in person, but it is fun reading the blurbs of the story/plot before each round & matching them to the soundtrack.
Fun game. Love the maps but some you can't pass because the amount of points needed to pass are impossible to get or require boosters to add more moves to get the points.
This was fun. But now I'm at a gate that needs keys. I have received 3 keys but the game is only recognizes 1 key so now I'm stuck. Also it freezes a lot. Constantly having to restart.
"***Updated Review***

I've dropped the stars since in this last update not much has changed. They did change it so they give you the first gate for free but that's about all I see as changed. There needs to be some major changes or they will lose all their players. 

Maybe they should read their reviews and fix the app accordingly. Pretty much everyone is complaining about the same thing. 

It would be better if it was just made a paid app with the gates unlocked, no need for lives or buying boosters. 

It's also horrible that it takes you out of the game to go to Facebook to post when you didn't even want to in the first place. Then it brings you back to the VERY slow load up of the game. No one wants to wait around for that.  I'm logging out of the Facebook connection for that reason. 

I really like the game. Smooth graphics and good storyline, however there are a few issues that makes it only 3 stars in its present state

1. The game (when it doesn't crash) loads extremely slow on start up

2. When loading a level, it loads extremely slow 

3. You only get to play 18 levels before the game holds you hostage in a sense. To continue, you either need to pay $2.99 or connect to Facebook and bug your friends to send keys. 

4. $2.99 for every 18-20 levels seems quite high to me as well as the booster prices. Why not just make it a paid app with the ability to purchase boosters but players have access to all levels. 

5. It doesn't give you a chance to try the boosters before having to purchase them. How do you even know what they do or if you even want them unless you try them first

Like I said, I really like the game and if any of the above improves/changes, I will be happy to update my rating and review."
They need to let you unlock more levels
Better since the update, however it keeps locking up  between levels at about level 30!   I have now made it to the 2nd gate and you STILL HAVE TO PAY or hassle people!  I don't mind the ads between the levels if it keeps in app purchases down! I really like this game but I am giving it a poor review because I don't like not being able to advance without paying or bugging people!
I don't like to have to sign into Facebook to get to through gates. Not going yo to that!!!
Trying to play this game is WICKED! I'm trying to get past level 36 and need keys. Friends have sent them to me but they will not unlock the 2nd key hole. I don't want to pay to go further. Waited for 4 days now. You people need to have it that after so many hours it opens. Work on it please.
Love the game. The App is kind if slow other than that it's great!
Game crashes constantly. Or in my case won't even start most of the time. Also you have to pay past the 2nd world or solicit your friends. Lame!
Stopped working with upgrade to iPhone 6.
And challenging. Perfect mix!
Very fun and very addicting
"The game is lots of fun, but it keeps freezing, thenI have to delete the whole game and reinstall
Then lose all my progress....I got all the way to level 18 and it froze again...and no way to ask for help...very frustrating!"
This game would be a typical match three except that it has a clever make a path mechanism. I quite enjoy it. I am also enjoying the story told  between levels. However, it seems very slow and clumsy in its actual performance. I still play it because I'm patient.
You HAVE to spend money to keep playing. If you're not into that, don't start.
It will not tell me how to find the key
This crashes a lot but gives entertainment with the different view of the story
I have nothing but a black screen
I would like to entertain my little cousin with this game but every time I go in it it crashes. Please fix!
Worst app ever. Stop using freemyapps and tricking people into buying this! I just wasted 5$ on an app I didn't even want.
"I'd love to give this app a higher rating but it crashes too frequently & if playing off Facebook the only option for moving to the next section is paying $$$ & that stinks! Developers should offer another option of making next section by scoring a certain number of stars or higher. Developer should also allow players to zoom out not just scroll around. Developers should not force players to watch all the instructions for each level if it is a level they have already played.

iPad & iPhone apps finally connect to Facebook, but in game mail won't open for me on any platform."
The game is fun,but freezes a lot
I love it!!!
Seriously! It crashed / locks up every other level and you want me to pay $2.99 to move to the next world? No thanks. Take a lesson from Candy Crush. Ferreal.
"I am very disappointed in the game, I made it to level 18 , but can not move on , I wrote 4 time & still the game won't give me keys to open to move on . I even delete the game & put it back on, & still does work, my 2 friends were able move on. I also have 3 stars on 1-18. I can not afford to buy the keys. It is sad as I really enjoy the game.
 Thanks pat"
I love this game!  Had some problems with getting requests in the game at first but seems better.
"This thing crashes at the same time in the same level...

I am not impressed and I'm sure not giving them any money right now...it's too bad cause it's a fun game.

Good luck with it...I think it's going in the trash can..."
Addicting. I like the storyline that's why I play, but it's very challenging as well.
The first night I played this I was up until 1 am. So much fun. Not too hard, not too easy. Just so much fun!
Good game but needs a tutorial and right now it is running as fast as molasses!!  Room for improvement to say the least.
I love that this game exists cause I'm obsessed with the play. But it does run a little slow.
I like this game a lot. Just wish the screen was full view.
I love the game but hate the pay structure. I don't want to pay three dollars to move to the next level. They need to change the structure so that you can complete a challenge or wait a certain amount of time to unlock.
As a huge fan of Wicked I was looking forward to this game.  I tried to play it multiple times but it kept crashing right after the "Loading" screen. (The one with the clock.  I love that it has thirteen hours instead of twelve!!! :D) Please fix this bug quickly!  I am so excited to play it!  Maybe a bit of chanting will help...eleka nahmen nahmen a tum a tum eleka nahmen...
Love playing the game....annoyed it freezes at times and paying to go to the next level because I only have one friend who also plays.
Game is fun to play, but app freezes too often. Sometimes levers don't appear when visiting wizard, and app loses track of how many stars you have. Sticking to Facebook for now
I have had a lot of fun playing this game. I did have an issue with the game when it froze and I couldn't go any further, but I sent an email about my issue and they fixed it for me as quickly as possible. Now I'm back to playing and couldn't be happier!
My favorite musical as a game how awesome I love it
Love the game.  Don't like having to beg people or buy keys.
I love this game and am always checking for updates. Well we recently got an update that says there are now more levels (even though it's only a few extra levels) but I can't see them. I still have a roadblock. I even deleted and reinstalled the app and that still didn't work. I think they need to hire an app developer from King because they have theirs all together.
...SO WHY DO I HAVE TO TO GET TO THE NEXT LAND WITHOUT LOSING THREE DOLLARS (which I don't have, because I pay with gift cards,  and I'm out, but it's a moot point, because I SHOULDN'T HAVE TO PAY THREE DOLLARS) what the &@$% guys?!?!
Interesting concept for a game and very fun to play. Love that you can play it from different ends of the board and finish the game backwards, forwards, up and down.  Better than a lot of games currently being played.
I love this game and became addicted very quickly. My problem is that it freezes up more than I can play it. Every time I go to send friend requests it will lock up. It's impossible for me to get to the next level or do anything else.
Make it so it can play on the nook!!!!!! I would give it 5 stars BUT because of keys needed and can't get keys without paying or getting from friends. My family plays on nook. So I can not get keys.
surprised more people don't play it.
Hangs up continually
It's good, but it crashes every time I ask for a key and I'm not spending $2.99. Fix the bugs abc crashes and I'll give 5 stars.
It fails to advance to the game board. I'm stuck on the play game screen!
It's a great game until you reach level 18 and if you want to continue, you have to buy a key to unlock more levels.  I deleted it.
Full of bugs and if there is a way to contact the developer it is well hidden! Some squares remain empty after a match. The caged animals vanish and you can't match with the icon that shows up in their place. The game often doesn't sense when no moves are available (well, there is one several screens over when you've already been!) When you make boost giving matches you do not always get full value for the match. Always offering easy ways out for $$.
I love to play this game, however, I can afford the frivolous expense if in app purchases and I only have one friend playing so I can't progress. When you can't move forward the game is done. Gonna delete if this isn't remedied.
Really fun,  but, can't advance levels without $$ or friends, but no one is playing it, so no pay, no play.
Super fun !!!!
Won't load on the app anymore plus makes it hard to advance when you don't want to pay and don't have friends that play
I enjoy this game so much, but as I get closer to a gate it get angry. You can't go on unless some friends help you but none of my friends play. I paid to go on twice but then the game froze and I was forced to reload it and start over. Come on... Fix these problems.
I enjoy the game immensely but where the hell are my keys?!?  Friends send me keys and then they mysteriously disappear.  Very frustrating.
Ok y'all need to get more lvls!! Its pitiful that in the second book you can only play so far!  And yes its irritating that u have to wait for boosts from ur friends! Time to pull ur heads out of the sand and update!! Until then i have no option put to rate a 1...
"Like this game but don't like that friend can only give one Kay that counts to open gate. Have gotten key from same/only friend playing on multiple days but only the first key they give counts the other keys on other days are ignored. 

Also haven't been able to play for the past couple days, get to hit play button and then it just keeps trying to download for ten minutes never accomplishing anything.  Can't play anymore!!   :("
Fun game I just don't like asking friends when I need keys
Hate that you have to shell out $2.99 to advance or connect to Facebook. Not cool.
"I have the same complaint as most of the reviews I see.
It would be 7 stars from me if it wasn't so hard to advance to other kingdoms. 
I absolutely love the game and hope this issue is resolved. 
I have not had trouble with the game crashing except in one aspect. When you try to send or receive request from Facebook. This means there is no way to advance without paying a very high price. I would contemplate paying $0.99 but have no intention of paying over two dollars."
I really like this game, but whenever I clear my cache or updates occur it won't load on my computer or my iPad.  Too bad, it's fun, but this is too aggravating.
I only have time for games when I'm in line waiting for a dr apt or the like. I enjoy wicked the book and musical, so I gave this a try. It's not too frustrating that u put it away and never play again but I like candy crush better. This game takes a long time to load each level and like I said I don't have that much time to wait.
This would be a five star game if I could actually get past the first country...I have been waiting over a week for a key to open the gate. When I try to request from a specific friend on FB who I know plays this game, the app freezes and I can't ask for help. And I'll be damned if I'm paying $2.99 every time I want to advance in the game. CIA they don't update, I'm deleting.  This is ridiculous!
I would give this game 5 stars if I didnt have to sign on to Facebook and ask my friends to play to advance to the next level.
Love the game but stop playing please fix it.
Fun game to play, but...need at least 3 friends to go anywhere without paying for each level, crashes a lot!, and with newest upgrade can't get to even open on my iPad.
i cant connect to facebook i dont kno why i keep clicking the connect button it acts like its doing something in order to connect but then it goes to the home screen with the connect to facebook logo
Can't even play the game. It does the load screen, then crashes. Please fix this. I would love to play!
"Fun for first City but they make it impossible to get more keys to move on to new City's. Game is new so no one is on FB to ask. Oh well.
July 8, 2014 update. App keeps freezing and crashing. Huge bummer because it's a great game but no one monitors the app to make updates. This game has huge possibilities. First of all who needs FB. Be creative and allow those of us who want to advance without it. Charge one fee at the beginning like other games. Make challenges to advance to other levels not $$$ and FB friends. No luck with any updates so far. Crash crash crash. :("
It's been way over a month, and I can't log on to Facebook to get my progress to continue playing. Why haven't you fixed this yet???
Enjoy the challenge.
It's a fun game to play but once you get to level 19 you have to ask a friend on Facebook to get you passed or you have to pay $2.99 to pass. Why can't I just play the fun game. I love the story of Wicked every level you pass you get a section of the story. I like it but then you have to pay or quit.
After each level, when I tap "continue", the app crashes, the only way to get to the next level is by exiting and restarting the app.
This is a fun game when you have a little extra time to waste.
I also was having trouble with the game crashing until I updated my iPad and then I have been fine. Overall I like the game.. Do not like having to buy stuff to get to the next level though..
"I love the game but I HATE that I can only advance by 1) connecting to Facebook 2) have friends play the game and help me 3) pay gobs of money to advance, play a few levels then pay again to advance.

The developers need to take a page from Candy Crush developers. You don't have to be on Facebook to advance. You don't have to have Facebook friends playing to advance. And you don't have to pay gobs of money to advance. 

The show sells out every show so it's not like it's hurting and the proceeds from the game isn't going to a charity so why charge to advance? I'd rather pay once for the game than be expected to pay to play 

If you pay attention to us reviewers and change this I'll be happy to add more stars. Until then you get one star only because I have to give a star and I can't give part of a star.

The app is also very very slow loading, loading between games, and between screens."
Have to restart to get from level to level. Please fix.
Awesome game!
Hard but fun
This game is cursed. Please fix this game. It crashes all the time. You can't get keys by asking friends and it's not worth paying for.
I love this game.....when the app works. When I first started playing this game it worked great. Now, within the past few day, whenever I finish a level the app freezes and I have to restart my device to get the app to work. Or I have to delete the app and start over. That's annoying. If this doesn't get fixed soon I'm deleting the app permenately!
Very interesting game only problem, if you don't buy anything you cannot get past gate 18. I'm out.
Can't send requests due to crash
This game is awesome-- Finally a puzzle adventure worth playing. Race you to the emerald city.
Love this game!!!!
"You can not get anything, lives, keys, etc, from the app. You have to pay or go on a desktop computer. WHY have an app???!!!

Update- app does not synch at ALL with desktop. Creators don't respond to emails. Makes it impossible to get keys for gates with more holes. BAD BAD BAD app but they don't care. Desktop shows me a whole level behind what I am!

About to give up on this one. Works, then doesn't work. Now showing me at level 1!!!! So I deleted and reloaded, now it won't even open!!! Don't put an app in store TIL YOU HAVE IT WORKING!!!!

Q"
I like it.  It is easy to play and entertaining.
I love the game just hate that is crashes when I'm trying to send requests on facebook
Worst game of this kind
I've played it a total of 5 minutes. It run horribly slow and it shut down on me. So far it is not a winner for me. Deleting it now.
I love Wicked and I like this game, but it crushes all the time!!
I love the game but when it crashes after every level and now when I try to play, it's frustrating.
Unreasonably difficult  80,00 to pass level is impossible to get I have  tried many many times.and helper and way to much money.
I like other reviews I've read am VERY DISAPPOINTED that you need to pay to get to the next section!! It is too much & I have no friends playing this game!!
I don't know if this is fun or not. I can't get level 2 to open. This is a waste of time.
Wish I could play this but it acts like its loading then it crashes ): so sad I love wicked
"Developers have to work on the Ipad App. Messages don't work,  
 game doesn't synchronize with facebook, etc. Game on facebook works perfectly."
Okay, the game itself is fun. I enjoy puzzle games and love the musical Wicked, so I do enjoy playing. However, I've progressed to Winkie Country and find myself more and more agitated. You're only given a certain number of movements to complete the puzzle and you have to earn so many points. To help make it more possible, the game will automatically reshuffle the pieces if there are no possible matches to be made. The problem arises when there are matches that can be made but they don't help the progression of the puzzle. When you only have, say, 30 moves for a puzzle, every move needs to be toward the completion of that level. I get frustrated when I have to waste some of my moves to make completely unnecessary matches for it to reshuffle so I can finish it. More often than not, if I manage to finish, I only get one star because I just barely made it. I would say the developers need to fix this.
"Brilliant game concept, but very very STUPID on the money and Facebook part!! Way to go to get people hating your game!!
I'd pay $5 for THE WHOLE GAME (meaning all gates combined).
ALSO......I paid $2.99 for the Enerald City 'section' but can't go past level 80.  WHATS UP WITH THAT?!!   Makers of the game.....get your head in the game!!!!  Read your reviews!!  Your LOOSING customers!!!"
Please fix crashing and bugs :(
I have one friend that plays this game. Therefore I can't go any further. I won't pay to play so it looks like I'm done.
This game was fun, until I got to the first gate. Nope, not connecting to Facebook, and not paying 2.99 (!!!) to unlock one gate. Also, I can't keep it running in the background to go back and play again, I have to completely close it each time or it crashes. It's getting deleted.
Every time I tap this app it won't let me play it
I really enjoy this game but often it freezes up, mostly when I'm trying to send lives or requests. Also, there needs to be a way to get to the next level without having to bother my friends to do it. Annoying!
Unique concept for match 3 but once again hate having to either pay or bug friends to advance. It's been fun but Goodbye!
Fun!
"love game but think you should have better pptions to continue levels 

i will buy a game but not pay as you go"
Haven't ever even gotten to play as it won't even load just crashes should have read reviews before purchase ugg fix this problem please!!!!!
Just saw the show, excited about the game, had fun playing.....then bam they want your $$$$.   Nope....would have paid a little up front but not now.
This game is very hard to load.  I have to close all apps, and restart my iPad.  Please fix.
Can even play the stupid game because it keep crashing..... What a waste.
I really do like this game but the only way to advance is Facebook or pay. I'm sorry that is ridiculous . I would pay for the game as a whole. Wish I could give more stars
"I was hoping for a fun puzzle game. This one really is set to
Force you to purchase items in order to complete the puzzles. Rip off"
"Waiting and waiting and waiting . Tired of it. It shouldn't take this long for updates. Been waiting since 4/24 for more levels. What is going on...?
I love the concept, so I gave a good rating. BUT I read in the comments there were more updates, but I don't see them. What gives"
Fun
I just downloaded this and i have yet to even get to the game as it crashes while loading. How dissapointing!
Cost too much but, it's fun.
Was excited about this game really enjoyed it until u can't get to the next land w/o paying 2.99 or hoping ur friends will play so u can unlock <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A4>
Would love to give you more stars but can't justify it with the gate being locked. Have tried to get my daughter on as a friend and it won't let me add her. We can not afford to pay either as husband has been unemployed for 2 1/2 years. So have played 1-18  a lot. Would love to get beyond that.
I get they want to make money but $2.99 is crazy.    Requiring others to give you a key or pay $2.99 is tough.  Should have the option to wait a few days to move forward if you don't want to pay or connect with facebook
I installed this game probably two weeks ago but every time I try to play it, I get the wicked screen and the app closes - or it does the clock "loading" and the app closes.  What a waste of time...
I was excited to see a puzzle game involving Wicked. I love the Musical and was glad to see that this existed. This game is getting 1 star as I hate being forced to connect to Facebook to try to maybe get friends to unlock additional portions of a game and $2.99 for each section is way too high a price. I would rather pay a max of $2.99 and not have to connect to Facebook to play a game.  There is also no way to sign out of Facebook on the app once it is connected. If there was an option to buy the app instead of forcing Facebook down my throat in hopes of getting "friends" to help you move on I would consider giving a higher rating as the first 19 levels were enjoyable but I will not pay 2.99 to move on once and it continues like that through out. Change the way you make people advance and I would consider giving a higher rating.
I thought this game would be awesome with it's concept and what it was based on. I played the first two levels and now it crashes and kicks me off on the 3rd level. Things need to be fixed soon or I will delete the app and never recommend it.
Great game, lags and keeps crashing.. Pls fix!
I would love to give a 5 star rating BUT please fix the glitches...I am tired and frustrated of being crashed on in the middle of games, purchases and just getting on the game. It crashes just after loading, it crashes when you choose your level, it crashes after you finish a game. Please fix it!!
Have had to delete and start over 3 times. Have trouble connecting to FB. Love the game but hate the issues. Now I only get play and it never loads. I've had it.
I love this game, but I don't like the fact that it plans on hooking the player in then making the player continue to pay to get through each door. I'm willing to pay for a game but this is ridiculous. Deleting this game today.
Love this game it's addicting n fun
Graphics are beautiful, game is challenging and fun. Can't wait until new levels are added!
Fun idea, but crashes or sticks constantly.  PLEASE FIX THESE BUGS BEFORE WE HAVE TO ELPHABA YOU.
I don't like that the only way to advance is to pay or get friends to help you. I have no friends to help me go to the next world, and I refuse to pay to advance! Maybe there should other ways to move on. Plus this game crashes on my iPad and I would rather play it there with the bigger screen.
Fun game. Different from others. Only complaint is the cost to open next level. $3 seems too high! Especially since each level is only about 20 games and they can go pretty quickly. $1 seems more reasonable
The app never loads.....
Crashes everytime I try to play it
I love it and the graphics and very addicting and fun! The only down fall which I would hope that they will fix is that every time I play a game after I am done it crashes which means I have to click on the game again to keep playing and it's getting annoying! Please fix the problem! Don't wanna delete!
Just downloaded but it has opened once and closed 15 times. Or is constantly loading, really making me angry.
Keep crashing not worth getting would b real good if u could keep it running
It's amazing how they managed to refresh the match-3 formula with this new game style. It totally offers a new level on the fun where the strategy pays off to beat the level, it feels great to see how you can progress in these huge boards like if it was an adventure.
Crashes every time I open it
I enjoyed the first levels a lot, I hope there are more levels coming soon!
Like the game it does shut dwn a lot but I'm patient!
This game is one of the best (and most beautiful) puzzle games I have ever played. Great for fans of the musical and puzzle fans alike. Great mechanic, complex and deep levels, great story adaptation! Make more levels please!!!
Perfect for anyone and everyone!
I downloaded it but it won't open!
Fun game BUT....won't connect to Facebook and I can't get past the first gate and I'm not willing to pay $2.99 to get through it. Disappointed .
Disappointed the update did not open new levels.  I have 3 stars on all ... Give me more please.  Don't make me bring out the flying monkeys!
Like the game but unlocking the next level is a little bit of a pain but besides that good game
So far so good! Loving this game! Love the bits if the story as you go!
Would be a good game if I could actually play it on my phone or iPad the app never loads!!
Need to be faster at getting more leaves or give me my $ back.  Plus price is different on ipad and FB
This game is different then others I like that you have to make it through the map to win.
I'm absolutely obsessed with this game but the doors you shouldn't have to rely on friends to help you open them. I have no friends that desire to play this game so in stuck at the first door. With all the points that you get you should use those as like money to open the door. Otherwise what's the point of the points. Or use the stars. Either way relying on friends that you don't have is stupid and I want to start playing again. I'll give 5 stars to this amazing game once this is done until then you get 3. Another thing is when playing on the computer I should be able to make it full screen it would be easier for me cuz I'm kinda blind and the screen is a small box either make the game bigger or make it possible to full screen.
I love this game and have lots of friends that would like it also...but until you can connect to Facebook from your Ipad I can't give a higher rating... Going to stop at level 18 until this is fixed..... Do not bother... They are just another money grubbing developer... They don't fix problems...2.99 a level is ludicrous.... Then I paid .99 because I was one move from winning..I completed the level and scored over the pts needed to win... And it said failed... I deleted the app as all should until they fix and make it work with Facebook and lower new levels to .99
Fun
Same problems, won't connect to Facebook and I'm not paying any $3.00 just to get through that one gate. Had good potential...probably deleting the app and just playing on Facebook unless something changes.
I love this game on Facebook , BUT I cannot even get on it on my iPod :(
Was really enjoying the game and then the next day when I tried to play it wouldn't load any longer.
I have had the app for about a month now and it will never let me play. It will get to the screen with the clock showing that it is loading but after it just locks me out and makes me go back to my main screen. I have a iPod four and it is updated to iOS 6.1.6. I understand that the app is only for fifth generation but please make it available for fourth too
Good game when it actually works on my iphone. Keeps shutting off every time I try to play n than takes a live from me… please fix this problem
This game is so much fun! But, app doesn't work well. Can't open it. Can only play on the computer. Asked people for help, they say they did, and it won't let me accept their help or ask them again.
Love the game when it will let me play it the app won't load most of the time and when it does it will stop in the middle of the game.
I really like this game, fix it or I'll be forced to just delete. :(
I love this game; however ever since I unlocked the second land it crashes the second the game loads.  I have an iPad 2nd generation.  Please fix.
Haven't even been able to play it. Crashed EVERY time loading the game.
Just downloaded the app and it won't load.
I really enjoy this game, until I came to the first gate.  It won't let me pass without paying $2.99.  I think I would pay that for the game, but I am afraid that it will cost $2.99 throughout the game, with more gates to come, so I am deleting it.
I just want to play games that don't require $$$ to move on or friends to ask. This game was fun till I came to the next level and have to pay $$ or ask friends for help. I just want to play without the BS!
I love this game but it can be frustrating at times.  I can't seem to get that third star on one of the challenges.
Good game but crashes too often & the forever reloading wastes too much time. Spend more time waiting to load or reload than having fun playing the game.
At the last level I can go. Waiting forever for a update. Stuck at level 81. Slow update
Fun and challenging for the whole family! Easy pop up directions. Good options. To add a different spin, try working backwards. Definitely a great game!
I love playing the game on my iPad...when it works!   It's a very addicting game, and I am stuck at the first gate with no hopes of getting past without paying. I don't want to pay $2.99 for a game that constantly crashes.  Hoping for updates to make it better!
I would love to play this game, but it will not even open on my iPad!
Fun but needs to get glitches worked out.
I would love to try this game but every time I click on it; it says loading and then kicks me out. Nothing like downloading a game you can't play!
I don't mind paying for in-app purchases ... Sometimes!!! But $2.99 to get thru the 1st gate, I don't think so! You do offer the option to ask friends for help, but the 2 friends I had quit at the 2.99 point & I don't see a place to ask for new friends. Too bad this could be a 5 <U+2B50><U+FE0F> Game
I love it but I can't get it to connect to Facebook to unlock the first gate. About to delete.
I conected to Facebook so I can ad friends to help me open the first gate,but They not receiving my invite so i never receive any help and Im NOT paying 2.99 to open just one gate!
Sorry it's a cool game.... But I'm so not paying $3 to continue to the next level. Deleting app
My wife downloaded it to her iPad and it worked fine a little slow but fine. So I got it for my phone and it won't load and it keeps kicking me off. So needless to say I'm not all that thrilled with this app.
Most fun of this best game ever but one negative... Must pay $2.99 for enter keys and ask friends on Facebook. No one interesting on this game... I want to be continue game. :((
Fun game, but it crashes all the time! Sometimes it won't open back up! Frustrating! I don't want to delete this app but I may be forced to if it keeps up.
Love the game EXCEPT crashes ALOT!!!
Played the first two levels and really liked it but, I can't play it anymore because it keeps crashing whenever I open it...
Loved playing the game, even through ALL the crashes. However, now I'm at the first gate at it says to "...find the three keys..." WHAT 3 keys? At first I thought there was a little hidden object mini-game tossed in & got super excited (to my disappointment). Or I could unlock the gate for $2.99. Well, sorry. I refuse to gave to pay that kind of money to unlock a new level to any game. It was a good ride while it lasted.
The app will not open. Deleted and reloaded app but it still crashes so have deleted it again.
Cant get it to play it loads then it shuts off
"Why bother with it if it doesn't even load. 

Don't waste your time!"
I was super excited to play being a Wicked fanatic fan. I played through the first 18 stops on the map for level one. Now I can't get through the gate. I even back tracked to max out stars at stops 1-18. Still stuck. So I wait at the gate.
I deleted and reinstalled this app a dozen times because it kept freezing. It's a fun game but too unstable. Not worth the aggregation
The game keeps shutting down and I have a feeling it has something to do with the fact that I won't allow it to post to Facebook on my behalf. It asks you after each round and shuts down after three rounds. Today it won't stay open at all. What a disappointment.
I love Wicked so I downloaded this game. It crashes constantly!! I can't even get passed the 4th level. Ugghhhhh
I was so excited to play this game, because I'm a huge fan of wicked! But I can't even get past the loading screen and then it turns off. I will be deleting this game. I hope they get the problem fixed so I can play.
Crashes at the loading screen. Every. Time.
I love the game, but I keep getting closed out of it.  It is so irritating.  Otherwise it is very challenging and I can't wait to play it.
I can't even get the game to load. It comes up says loading then boots me out. I have deleted it and reinstalled in numerous times just to get the same results.
I've only gotten through a few levels, and they've been fun, but the app crashes way more than it works! Please fix!
Love this game. Only it says I have 3 messages and when I click on it nothing shows up.
Love this game! <U+2764><U+FE0F><U+2764><U+FE0F><U+2764><U+FE0F>
I would really like to play but it wont go past the load screen on my ipod. Please fix it!
"This game is a lot of fun but I can't open the app on my iPhone :(

Not trying to compare to other games but this reminds me of the dumb candy crush game BUT this is much more fun! Please fix this from crashing i'd love to play on my phone as well as on a computer"
The game doesn't fit on the phone screen or in the space alloyed in my laptop. You can see the entire playing area at once. I might just quit playing it.
After the update, level 65 tells me to "please connect for a one time download." I don't know what I'm supposed to connect to. There are no more updates in the App Store and I tried deleting and downloading. Works fine on my iPad but my iPhone won't open the next level and takes away a life every time I try.
This is fun to play, and very challenging.  Almost TOO challenging.  You need 15 stars in order to play the mini-game and get boosts, which help when completing a level.  I'm out of boosts and stuck on a level, so I wish the game had a daily draw (or something similar) where players could win boosts every day, instead of just playing a level over and over again, with no hope of ever passing a level due to lack of boosts.
Before this update, I had two friends playing. Since there was so much wrong with it, they have deleted their app. Now, I can finally click on the first gate and I have to ask friends or it states "open gate for US .99". I figured I'd splurge on the .99, but when I click on it and put my password for the .99, it says they are charging me 2.99. First of all, it stated "open gate for US .99" but 3 x .99 is 2.97 if you do your math. I am going to delete this game because I refuse to pay to get through each gate from this point on. There are other games that don't have a price to get to each level. They have you certain things every 12 hours to get the three keys ( or whatever).
Love Wicked, loved the beginning of the game and now can't do anything.....FIX IT!  Make us all happy!
Love the Facebook version. iPhone App till won't work. Says it's loading then boots you right out. Worked for about a week, but not in past 2 weeks. <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A4>
Just updated. Now the app will not open the 'new level' that was supposed to have been added. And it takes away a life everytime I try to open it.
It tends to crash... A lot. I hope it gets adjusted in future updates. Otherwise, great game and hope they release different ones based on the show.
This is the best game ever!
"please fix the fact that it keeps crashing I play the game on Facebook but I would like to play it on my phone now 
thank you"
My sister is obsessed with this game. She keeps asking my mother and I to give her keys so she can move onto the next level. The problem is, is that when I am @ work I can only access the internet via my phone. I have tried several times to accept her requests, but it won't let me.
... crashes constantly! Please fix so I can play my game! :(
Might be a decent game but I'll never know.  Crashes all the time.  I don't get anything from friends.  Hope u fix all the glitches
I love this app when it works, which is rare. Please fix the crashing issue!!!!
Ok for the first 30 levels or so, then they get too challenging. They get super hard and there are definitely some design flaws.
Very fun game love it
I can load the game but it will not load to play.
Makes you think a head so you don't run on the moves before the end
Every time I tried to open the app, it crashed and I was never able to get past the loading screen in the very beginning.
I really like this game, it is fun and challenging. However, it needs major improvements to fix the lagging, freezing, and crashing that are constant, and soon before you lose more players.
It won't let me go to level 64
Some levels will not load. Please fix game is fun to play.
If you don't have any friends playing this game, you will only make it through the first level. Makes for me, who doesn't have any friends playing it, a disappointment. It was really fun to that point!
I really wish we could play through the whole game. Having to get three keys that often is a pain. I'm going through withdrawals because I can't play past the level I'm at.
I think it's ridiculous that you have to pay $2.99 to advance..the only way to advance is to connect to Facebook and ask for keys or pay...that's why I gave it a one star not everyone has facebook. Or wants to be spending money to play a game..I won't be paying..uninstalling!
I cannot connect the game on my iPhone to the game on line. Otherwise it's fun.
I wish I had read the reviews before I downloaded it loved it and then ran into the same problems. I sent a request on your site but unlike other apps where you at least get an automated thanks for letting us know I have heard nothing. Hope this gets fixed if not I will be sending it packing.
It's an awesome....beta, if you will, but I think you really need to focus on the actual programming part of the game, especially for the desk top version on Facebook. There's a lot of bugs that need to be worked out, i.e. glitching when objects are coming down, dropping more matches so people aren't stuck on the same level for all of eternity, the point system to get the first star on a level....things like that. I've noticed, too, the iPhone app crashes a lot, and the desk top version doesn't like to load.
Love this game but the bugs here and there make me want to quit - can not receive any requests and have to ask support every time I reached a gate  because unable to access my in box- would give this game a 10 star if it wasn't for all the bugs here and there
Couldn't go further than level 4; kept force closing.
I love the game on FB, but the app won't let me link it to FB....I am pretty far and REFUSE to start over!!!!
I am running iOS 7 on my iPad. Should be able to download and play this game. The first time I tried to download it, I got the entire freaking Playbill - 30 or so pages! No game! The second time I was able to download the game. Tried to open it, watched it load... Waiting... Waiting.... Poof. Shut down. So disappointed!
Wicked the musical is my all time favorite musical. I was so happy when I found this app. It's slow and the field around the game board is small so you can't move that easily. My one request is to have Wicked music in the background. (Defying Gravity, Popular, What is This Feeling)
If you can't tell I love this game. For me it is very addictive and very challenging. Overall a great way for me to entertain myself during my down times.
I play this game on Facebook and it's a great game but I've downloaded this app 3 time and each time when I go to open it it freezes!!!
Game is cool til you get to the door. I will not ask friends for keys nor will I buy them. Please fix so we can keep going=(
"I love the game, but I don't like not having the ability to zoom out to see the whole map.  I also don't like that the screen automatically moves in the direction of flow.  It needs to be easier to move the field of view around.

The app is too buggy to enjoy.  Can't see enough of the screen.  Loads very slowly.  Appears ""laggy.""

I hope you make good changes.  The game is fun."
Game lags on an iPhone4. I'm using wifi so what's up with that? Other than laggy collapses, it's got potential.
Love love love this game. It's challenging without being frustrating, and a total plus that it is Wicked themed <f0><U+009F><U+0092><U+009A>
Very frustrating and I can't move on. You can ask your friends for help, but only from the locked gate that you can't pass. You can receive requests from friends, through Facebook, but when you click them, the app opens but you don't see / can't find anywhere to help them. Also, if you open the map by clicking your Facebook icon, you have to critically terminate the app to get out of it. A real shame, this game really made good use of the story and had real potential of being a great game... Hope you fix it before we all delete it...
"Never let's you open messages to get the keys from friends. 
Says there are no matches left when you are in the middle of making one. 
Says you've failed a level bc you didn't make enough points before it actually added all your bonus points to see that you indeed won."
I love this game. I don't have enough friends who ply to unlock the next door, so I just keep replaying other levels to get more stars. So glad it is an app now.
I love this game and the overall concept but crashes all the time and moves super slow :( hoping for an update soon !!!
Live game on fb  but won't load on iPod  shame going to delete. I get loading screen then shuts down
There are several bugs in this game.  The worst one is you ask friends for keys to unlock the next level.  Then messages never load so you can't get the keys to unlock!  So frustrated I'm ready to delete this game!!
I like the nature of this game but it has too many glitches...such as not being able to connect to FB and constant crashes. Disappointing :(
Still after upgrade still can't open messages on iPhone or iPad. Just hangs and freezes the app. This is an epic failure of a release that was to fix that!!!!
The game is awesome I am at the 1st door and it keeps freezing when I click on the door :-(
I love this game on fb (until the keys were added to get to next village) so I was really excited when it was made into an app. The thing is....I can't open it. I can only see the loading screen. I really want to play this game on my iPod but currently I can't. Even after the update I STILL CAN'T OPEN AND PLAY THE GAME!!!
Love the game but will not ask friends for keys and refuse to pay $2.99 for them. Will delete.
Ended up deleting this app. Couldn't get past the first gate and I am not going to pay to do it. I am not going to waste precious space on my phone for a app I can't play.
Love, love, love the game...addicted! But I've reached level 81? I believe? Just made it thru the last gate and it keeps telling me to check for more levels later....why? Why? Why?!!!  Lol. I want to play more NOW!
"Definite improvements from before. The magic broom sweeping away the stones is awesome!! <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008A>
***********************************
I. Will. Not. Pay. To play a game. Sorry. I wouldn't mind asking my FB friends...if the asking feature was in tune enough to let you know which of your friends play (that way you don't bug people who don't). There NEEDS to be alternate ways to get through the doors: make little mini-games that can be accessed on a 24hr basis (like CandyCrush); join up with TapJoy and have people download apps...

I am REALLY LOVING this game and want to give a higher rating bbuutt..."
I enjoy this game so much...when it doesn't crash on me.  It generally takes 3 tries to open the game and after each section, it crashes and I have to try to open it again.  Please work out the bugs, or gremlins that are making this game crash all the time.
Fun game, but crashes very frequently. Also doesn't go far until you have to pay or get friends to join.
This is a good game.  Maps help you figure out how to navigate.   I am now trying unlock a door.  I have know ideal how.
I have downloaded this app since I played the game on Facebook and loved it. I however do not know how the app works since it will not let me load it at all. It crashes every time and I've deleted and downloaded several times. This app is not good. It needs a lot of improvement.
I like the game a lot but can't continue to play pass the second door when I try to purchase the keys of friend people. Lately it won't even let me open the app or forces itself to close in the middle of a game.
Says to come back later for more levels to play but I'm not at the end of the game I'm on level 66. Please fix!!!!
Love the game, but wants me to connect, which I am but it won't load, every time I try it takes a life. Only got to play one level today. Lost 8lives already today, and still can't play.
this is one of the worst games out there. It freezes up, can't get  past the wizard and now I can't even get on the site, no way to get people to come back to your site!
I like the challenge, but I can only see one FB friend & I know others that play. The app just hangs up when I try to open the messages even when I close everything else & restart my iPad, with all the iOS updates. <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A3> Fix these things & I will change rating to 5.
No friends play, have no way to use Facebook, can not get keys, can't  but them either....stuck!, other than that good game.
I liked it when it worked but that's rare anymore. Hate the games that require help from friends. If it was a good game, there wouldn't be a problem getting people to play.
This game was fun up until you have to get keys. I have asked for keys, but I cannot open my messages in the app to receive them. Now I'm stuck. Fun for the first few levels, but overall disappointing when you're stuck at the first door.
I can't figure out how to get it to my Facebook friends
Love the game but when I got to the first gate I was unable to ask friends or open mail.
Keeps telling me I need a one time download, but am not getting any options to. Download anything. Plus it takes a life just to tell me I can't play. Fix it please!!!
Love the book, plays and now the game :)
This game is fun when I can open it.  It won't let me open and play it most of the time.  When I can play it, it is VERY slow...
Challenging and fun!  Love the "Wicked" theme!!
Lots better than those other match three games... It's like a match 3 and puzzle in one
First 18 levels were fun.  Won't pay for keys or sign in with Facebook so I guess I am done.
I love this game but it kicks me out after each level.
The game won't even open. Just crashes constantly.
Played until hit a door to demand $2.99 or annoy FB people.
Loved this game when I played it on Facebook, but this app keeps crashing (I haven't been able to open & play it NOT EVEN ONCE since I downloaded it). I've even tried reinstalling it...(needless to say IT STILL DIDN'T WORK!!!) What is the deal people? Y'all have got to to better!!!
It crashes every time I open the app. Please fix this.
While I enjoy playing the game itself, the app is VERY stressful!!! It takes 3-4 times trying to open it before it actually opens. It starts opening then kicks you out. I loose my lives just trying to connect. I tried deleting and reinstalling the app but it didn't help. PLEASE fix this issue!!
Stuck on the first gate! It keeps freezing! Please fix!!
I love wicked any WAS enjoying the game, but now I can't even get the game to load. Would appreciate if you could fix that.
love the game but i have the same issues as other people - PLUS i did pay to play longer & can't get a refund - never received the credits!!! can't get keys from friends - can't see their requests, etc - PLEASE PLEASE fix these and all other issues pointed out by others!!
I will not pay or pester Facebook friends to move on in this game. Like others, none of my Facebook friends play this game. Until that glitch is sorted out I won't be playing; which is sad because I really enjoy playing. It's quite addicting!
I love the show Wicked, so I was overjoyed that there was a game for it. The game is fun! But there are bugs that need to be fixed, please! The screen freezes when I try to click the gate to ask for keys and the one time it worked to send the request, it wouldn't work on my sisters end. "With a {game} like yours, dear, there is a definish chance, if you work as you should, you'll be making good"
I love wicked as was really excited when I heard about the app but when I try to open it crashes fix please!!!
I have to agree with previous comments! This has potential to me an amazing game if the lag time got fixed! I also would not pay the 2.99 at every door, maybe once for the entire game sounds better! It seems like a work still in progress, so I will not give up on it!
Like the game however there is a lot of lag time. And it frequently stalls while loading and goes back to your home screen.
This game lags and freezes really bad plus it will not let me connect to Facebook. I will continue to play this on Facebook than bother with the app. Was really disappointed with this app :(
I can't even open the app.  Delete
As other reviewers have stated, I will not ask my FB friends to play this game and I will not pay $2,99 to unlock a level. The game itself is terrific, but if no other option is provided to get through the doors, I am finished playing.
I really like the game a lot but.... It constantly freezes upon opening and $2.99 to get through the door is rediculously high.
Got to the first door & can no longer play the game. The game freezes. I have a message, but when I click to see what it is the game freezes. I refuse to bother people to send keys & I refuse to pay money for a key(s). Please fix. This game had so much potential, but is not fun if it doesn't work or can't even be played.
I adore wicked so this feed my obsession, love the story bits between games!
Just downloaded the game and It won't play. I have reset my phone three times and deleted the game and downloaded the game agin to no avail it still will not play
I like this game on FB but the app won't even open. Please fix!
I LOVE wicked and I love this game. But I connected to Facebook, and now I can't disconnect it. The game doesn't even load if it's disconnected from Facebook. I want to continue playing but I have NO Facebook friends who will play and I don't have the money to spend. Please change it so that there is an alternate option to open the doors, (like candy crush does). Not to mention I can't even play the game on my iPad because it crashes every time I open it...
Love the musical, and I love the game when it actually opens without crashing!
It won't load. Five times it's crashed at start up. I play it online and it's a great game, but I can't rate this properly until it...ya know LOADS
Like it but can't connect to facebook
It says loading and then closes.
I can play this game and it does not crash. The game gives an option to connect to Facebook but when I press it, it does nothing.
I am having some problems because it loading then it stops and sends me to my home screen
This is a great game but it is unbelievably slow and crashes all the time. If the bugs got worked out, I'd be hooked for sure. Sad.
Can't even open it to play. Difficult to review something that crashes every time you try to open it.
I really enjoyed this game, but was disappointed when I got to the end of the first land. I don't want to link this game to my Facebook, nor do I want to have to pay almost $3 every time I reach a door.
I would like to play this game because it is one of my favorite series but it loads then closes?  I would gladly play it when you fix it.
I've been playing this game on the web based Facebook version and my only complaint has ever been that I keep getting to a point where new levels aren't yet available. Happily a lot of the levels I've already beaten are quite enjoyable. This version of the game is a little further behind on levels, but very smooth and fun to play. I experienced some lag once but otherwise smooth sailing for the most part. I'm happy you created this mobile version. I use an iPhone 4S with iOS 7.
I love this game! There are a couple of things that need tweaks but my one complaint is once you hit "the door" you need to pay $2.99 or get tickets from friends in Facebook. I hate bugging friends for games and don't want to be bugged myself. I tried to disconnect from Facebook but once you connect there is not a way to reverse it. I want to play but if I have to pay to continue I won't be playing anymore.
I enjoy playing this game but it crashes occasionally. It takes a long time for each game to load. I don't like the little "cartoon bit" in between each game...I just want to play.
I like playing this game, but I'm annoyed at having to either purchase keys or ask friends to help open the doors. I just want to play. Is that too much to ask? Please fix this!!
I would love to play this game, but It won't open.
I really love this game and would play it more except that when I do finally get the game open, because it crashes when I try to open it every 3 out of 4 times, it is SO SLOW. Please fix and I will update my review! I want to play this game so much but I don't have the patience to sit while it lags :( please make it faster! <f0><U+009F><U+0092><U+009A><f0><U+009F><U+0092><U+009A><f0><U+009F><U+0092><U+009A>
Hi i loved wicked the musical first i saw it and i love this game to hope u play it if u like wicked the musical
I got to play level 1 with minimum problem. It has potential to be a fun game but it crashes or slows down WAY to much.
Won't open
I love wicked but I was very disappointed when it crashed my iPad!!
"I wish I could also play this game, won't work on my iPad or iPhone.  Keeps crashing after it says
It's loading."
Made it to level 4 but now crashes as it is loading. Also the game is very slow while playing.
I like the overall concept of the game but it is SUPER laggy for a match the objects game.
I love playing this online and when I found out that it was an app I got really excited but it was all for naught because every time I open it, it loads, and then it goes "NOPE" and crashes. Please fix it. I love this game.<f0><U+009F><U+0092><U+009A>
Haven't even played it yet... It crashes
I'd like to review the game zero stars but alas, I must give them one. Can't get the game to open. Don't waste your time
Every time I open it crashes.
So excited to install this as Wicked is my favorite. Can't tell if it's a good game or not. App shuts down before it even starts. I haven't once gotten past the loading screen. Bummer!
Doesn't always load! Most frustrating as it is a good game when you get to play!!
Game will not load keeps closing please fix
Game crashes! Please fix.
Would be fun to play if it ever loaded. Just keeps crashing.
Frustrating.
Not a problem with mine, opens right up and let's me play. I'm a huge Wicked fan so this is FABULOUS! 5 stars all the way!!!
I've downloaded it twice now, loads then closes. Will not open. Still haven't even seen the game.
If I don't have Facebook and don't want to pay the $2.99, is there another way I can keep playing? Fun game but I don't want to pay.
I was looking forward to playing this but it shows it's loading then promptly crashes. Really disappointing.
Looks cool. It only it would open for me.
Great concept, but......Disappointed, uploaded but kicks you out, cannot play!!
Won't load so I can't play. Please fix this.
Would be awesome if I could even open it!
Crashes every time cant play at all
Game loads then instantly crashes... Haven't even seen the game let alone play it!! Very frustrated!
"I can't get this to open. Have no idea if the game is good or fun because
I can't play."
I'd give this 0 stars if I could! It won't even open!
Would love to play .... But game crashes upon loading.. Disappointed
The app looks beautiful but when I open it, it tries to load then closes.  I deleted and re-downloaded but no luck.  I really hope this is fixed soon.
This game looks fun but it won't let me play it on my iPad it won't let me bring up the start menu to even play the game so I'm gonna delete it
Was looking forward to playing this. Downloaded and now can't open it. What's up with that?
Can't play it, it loads the game then it crashes
I have been a fanatic fan of Wicked forever and when I found a game for it I was soooooo excited!!!! But so far O haven't even been able to play the game because it crashes every time I try to load it. I am not sure whether its because my device is only IOS6 or what but I would love to play it. Please fix the bug soon!!!!!!!!!<f0><U+009F><U+0092><U+009B><f0><U+009F><U+0092><U+0099><f0><U+009F><U+0092><U+009C><f0><U+009F><U+0092><U+009A><U+2764>
"Super fun and addictive!
But quite a few glitches. It froze on me and I had to reinstall and I have lost my progress and all my bought items. 
Sometimes it's slow or doesn't work correctly. If these issues are rectified I would give 5 stars."
Started off slow and frustrating but it's improving. Need a time limit on being locked out, though, as so few of my friends play this game.
Reasonable until level 18 when you discover that you have to fork out $2.99us to open this and every door thereafter . Much too expensive for such a basic game. Very disappointed deleting now!!
Addicted!
So this is the second time I've downloaded this app and essentially it's great, but then... you can't continue without paying a rather large amount of money or forcing people from Facebook to assist you. This is very disappointing. As a grown woman I'm not wanting to infect Facebook with any more game requests
I'm stuck at Level 18. I have completed the level that many times, it's not funny. I've reached scores of 140 000+ repeatedly & filled the board at 72% or more repeatedly & it won't let me through the gate. I'm guessing that there are no keys unless you pay dollars to get through. I don't do Facebook - I want to achieve the levels without any help. I would have rated this game as 5 stars if this MAJOR glitch had not been occurring. About to swap to another game, unless this MAJOR bug is fixed.
I do like this game. But getting keys off your friends is abit annoying as not a lot of my friends play it. So now I'm stuck.
Im really enjoying this game but there are so many bugs to fix. There needs to be other ways to get lives amd keys as none of my friends play. Please fix as im loving this game... How do we find out when a new update is coming???
No info on how to open the gates
Every time I open this game, I get to the loading screen, that loads to 100% and then I get dumped out on my home screen. I have the required iOS update and an iPod touch.
Thought I would give this game a go despite the negative comments.  It is a great game but as everyone has said, on the ipad it freezes, shuts down by itself and won't sync with the game on Facebook which is frustrating.  I got to the first door and had a friend send a key.  I could get the key on my PC but not on the iPad which is where I needed it.
"I also agree that the constant shutting of the app is annoying. It also won't allow me to connect with Facebook so to go through the doors, my only option is to spend money. If these things are fixed, I would give it 5 stars.

Update to my comment: None of these issues are fixed. The shutting down of the app is now coupled with the freezing of the game. I have an iPad mini and would expect this not to happen....because more than just disappointed. I am altering my stars."
Really enjoying the game and the strategies involved to progress. Really takes the "bejeweled" style game to another level!! But Creators can you PLEASE fix the glitches in the game. For some reason my star scores aren't being added and I can't "visit" the wizard since entering Gallikin land. They are staying on 5 or 6 even though I've progressed up 3 more levels. Also even though I'm on my FB account it doesn't sync my game achievements to my other devices, even when backed up to iCloud etc.
"Had this game on my old iPhone 4s. When I got the 5 I synced it to my new phone, but it didn't update my progress. Even though it was linked to my FB. So had to start from scratch. Now I can't make it past level 19 because I can't click on the 'ask friends' button, only the 'pay now' button. 
Thinking about taking it off my phone."
Really disappointing, game shuts down on open and after completing every level when playing on iPad. Have emailed support and have yet to hear back a result. Won't work on Facebook either. Actually like the game when it can be played.
LOVE this game but can't connect to fb on my iPad and therefore can't sync with my progress on my computer :-( .. also drops out a lot too
Try to play it on my ipad, keeps dropping out and can't even play it on Facebook as it comes up with an error message. Please fix the problem
I can't connect to Facebook and progress any further.
The game drops out before I get onto the level. It loads up then it drops out.
I was at level 81 and couldn't go further! Got extremely excited when there was an update. Updated and well that excitement turned quickly to disappointment! I still can't play!
I really like playing this game. It's fun!!!
I have been playing the game and I didn't play for a month and every time I go into it it kicks me out on my iPad please fix as I am enjoying the game
"I really do love this game and I would like to rate it 5stars but there is to many problems :(
I have been waiting for a new update for more levels, as I had reached level 71 months ago. 
Now FINALLY you have an update that includes new levels and after I update and start playing I realize its a 1 level update!!! Why bother? It's just frustrating! 
Please make an update actually worth downloading!! One that actually completes the map would be good! Till then I'm disappointed."
Fun strategy game to keep the mind sharp.
Was enjoying the game a lot but am now stuck at the gate between lvl 36 & 37 & just get a black & white logo in the middle of the screen whenever I even try to pass through. The logo then freezes the whole app. A shame, was fun until this point
I agree with Jaglet3. Ditto all that. Other friends have same frustrations. Please fix!  This is a great game but needs things fixed.
What a shame it could have been such a good game well it was until you get to the first gate and I still can't get through it as no one has the game, also it takes forever to load and their are so many bugs that need to be filtered out. Maybe when it's been completed and all bugs are sorted out it will be a great game but I'm def not paying to get through the gates when the game doesn't even load after the new update
"Overall good game if you enjoy puzzle / mazes but even after updates the game has a lot of glitches
E.g. When tiles are cleared, they often stay empty unless you move off that part if the screen.
Also as I'm getting to higher levels many of the boosters sit frozen and / or tiles show 2 icons over each other and cannot be moved.

My biggest peeve about this game though is it constantly shows ""no matching tiles - reshuffling"" when there are in fact matching tiles available - I don't know if this is a glitch, the creators way of attempting to ""help"" the player finish or just a way to make more money from refills because it makes the game more difficult for no reason and incredibly frustrating when you have to sit and wait multiple unneeded shuffles. 

Good game if you have the patience for all the annoyances."
I have been really enjoying this game. But I have reached a doorway and need keys to go though, this is where it all falls apart, the game doesn't interact well with Facebook, and even when I'm sending requests and the requests are being received, and my friends are sending keys and lives to me, the keys or lives don't appear on my game screen to collect. So I'm stuck and I'm gutted about it, as I said I was really enjoying this game. Please developers fix this and I will carry on playing but for now I'm giving up:(
Still can't play level 64 - asks to connect to download required content then exits back to map. Don't have a Facebook account. Highly annoyed this level wasn't fixed
I played the beta of this game on my PC and was hooked pretty quickly was excited to see it available in the App Store however I have been unable to open it due to force closing. Hopefully this is fixed soon as it is a highly addictive game
Since the latest update the game crashes everytime  on start up... Please fix I'm having withdrawals!!!
Since the most recent update the game won't load past the opening 'loading' screen. Was a great game until now!
Awesome game when it wants to load. Ever since I hooked it up to Facebook it won't connect to the internet!! Very frustrating :(
Great concept, really addictive game, but horribly glitchy (as stated in most of these reviews). Particularly peeved when having made my way into the 60's on one of the earlier released versions to be kicked back to the start of the game and asked to pay money to get back to where I was. Can use the very many glitches in the game to your advantage though ;) - this game clearly still needs a lot of development.
Loving the app till I reached level 64 and can't proceed even with a Facebook account!!!!! Very disappointing and very frustrated....please fix this????
I reached a door. Messages don't load so can not advance. Very disappointed :(
Very slow and keeps crashing. Needs a major update to fix the issues.
Can't connect to Facebook. lost any keys or they did not register enjoyed the little I played taking the game off
Love this game
This would be a good game if I could actually log into Facebook, which it just won't connect to!   And there is no info on who to contact for help!
It's a fun game and stuff but the amount of bugs and the fact it doesn't even load, not good enough wouldn't download for that reason
Great idea for a game but you either have to hassle friends on Facebook or pay to continue. Rediculous, I suggest another way if it's possible. I mean come on it's wicked!!!!! Lol
So far I have really enjoyed this game - I reached the doorway after level 18 & that's as far as I've been able to go, because now it just doesn't want to load anything - so disappointed as I want to keep playing! Please fix it soon so I can keep Enjoying it <f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008D><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008A>
"Game took almost 90mins to download. And was def not worth the wait. 
Game play itself is very slow. Lots and lots of loading screens. 
Music in game is irritating. 
As are the little pop up help windows. I can't get past level 5 as the pop up window about the hammer will not go away. I can't see the game board underneath it and there is no clear part down the side so I can move the board into a better position. 
I loved this book. I enjoyed the musical. But this game is just pants."
Full of bugs, crashes doesn't load the list goes on !!!! Developers need to fix once and for all, not good enough
This was actually a great game, until I got to the next level and found I could choose between letting this app post on Facebook for me or paying $3 for the privilege of continuing. Thanks but no thanks. Delete.
After the latest update , when I open the app, it loads the game and crashes, it clearly isn't compatible with iPad 2
Kept kicking me out and when I finally got through to beginning level one time an instruction note popped up and wouldn't go away so I couldn't see the board or play.
Love the idea of this game had fun while it worked. Keeps crashing had to delete this game
Looked promising but it kept crashing when trying to load
I have just updated and now I still can't get into level 64, I thought updates were meant to fix these problems! Now I keep getting a message to come back for more levels later! I think I may just delete and forget this game, very disappointed!
"This is a great game when it wants to work. I have trouble getting it to load, then when it does load I can only get through one level. When it tries to go back to the map it shuts down and the whole process starts again.
When some bonuses appear that will also freeze and shut down the game.
I no longer will play until all is fixed and up and running properly with an update, hopefully this isn't to far away."
Great game but closes down constantly and is extremely glitchy. However when it does work it's pretty good. Fix the bugs!!!!
Love the game but it keeps closing down … as soon as that bug is fixed it will be AWESOME!!!
This game is visually appealing and has a great concept. It's fun to play. The only problem is that it's really slow and still a bit glitchy. Can't wait for an update to hopefully fix it
But shame the syncing between facebook version tablet version is broken. Please fix.
Mud game crashes while loading. Can't even get the start menu.
"Remind me of mega run, yet has more interesting achievement scheme. 

However some bunnies are activated even you are gliding into them. Had to be fixed"
This is one of the best games y'all need to get. Seriously its soooo cool!!!!
A mint game bring on run Sheldon 2 need more lol
Want a brilliant little game. Really addictive!!
A really fun game to play!
The game is fun and inventive and runs well on my iPhone 5.
a running turtle, mind blown. cool game also
Fun, kind of like a platform temple run.
Funny little turtle running around! What's not to like?!
Nice presentation and is quite fast paced!
Looks nice
This game runs (pardon the pun) very nicely on my iPod touch 4G with very little lag DOWNLOAD IT NOW!!!!
Awesome! Really good graphics
Great played it for days
Good app
nice game fun to play
Worth time to play.
A good game!
Good app
This is so good. If you don't have it you are odd!
My daughter and I are addicted the game, really fun!
Fun gameplay, great interface, challenging and well-worth your time.
A fun game which keeps you coming back. Only problem is that when you come across challenges you can do, you get stuck, should have option to spend coins to avoid having to complete challenges. Other than that, really good!
Great fun, addictive and good graphics, definitely recommend. The challenges get a lot more difficult as it progresses though.
I dont understand to bad reviews on this game to be honest.nice game,great controls all works fine. Playing for hours days when time off still interesting game.
I have been playing the game for weeks now..cant get enough of it, so addictive! i'd recommend it to anyone..
Disappointed by this game an do not recommend to any one
Game looks great but the turtle controls like a rock
This game is amazing and really addictive the graphics or detail is great when your in the forest but I think that the upgrades are alittle to much for like 2 seconds extra otherwise great game!
<f0><U+009F><U+0090><U+00A2><U+2764>
As good as games get on the App Store :-) you won't be disappointed
Amazing game! So addictive playing it on the ipad2 the only problem is that when I die it will force close,so I'm forever having to reopen the app :/ please sort it. And I always seem to land in front of enemies and he won't jump quick enough,so that's why I've rated at 4 stars other than that it's really fun. Download!
Just keep playing this, can't put it down! Recommend it to anyone especially if like me you love tortoises! <f0><U+009F><U+0090><U+00A2>
Enjoyed playing this game with such a varieties of levels...  Highly recommended !!!
Needs customisation for Sheldon like a girl version
Awesomeness in a game for free. I got it then made all my friends. Everyones addicted my hand now hurts a bit, but I hold the record :> Can't stop playing.. Run Sheldon… Runnnnnnnnn!
Run Sheldon is a game that will have you glued to your phones. It is really easy to set up and the instructions are simple and easy to follow along. It's a great game to play and provides endless entertainment. What's more this game is great to play with your friends, and you can challenge each other to see who will get the best scores. The graphics and quality of the imagery are also excellent as well, which all adds to the enjoyment of the game. I really enjoy the game and it is certainly addictive. I recommend this game wholeheartedly. As far as any negative points I really couldn't find any at all.
Really good gameplay with very cute graphics go guys get it. I am sure anyone will love it. Thanks a lot guys.
Wow the game have beautiful animation and graphics, a quality of paid game. I would highly recommend to download n play u would b addicted to it for sure.
A really great game with lots of variety, defiantly one of my top 10. One thing however, it would be great if we got some more customisation options for the character.
Run Sheldon Is an amazing game u should totally download it and its Free !!!!!!! How much better can it get
This used to be one of my favs.  It was challenging but moving through the levels was possible over time.  Now, it's impossible without buying boosters.  Hate to do it but this one's going to the trash heap.
Have written to support several times and all I get are empty promises to fix these poor updates. Used to be my all time fav, now the worst. Without having the coin magnet, it's impossible!!!  Bad move Johnny
Was working fine for a few weeks then BOOM!!! CRASHES!!! It won't even open!!!!! Help!!
Love playing the game but I wished the bubble, magnet and driving machine was activated longer.
Don’t be so lazy, here is a great funny game. I really get a real fun by playing this game. Specially I can when I challenge a friend of mine and defeat him .That’s a great feeling………..
Still crashes after the last 2 upgrades. The game isn't as fun as it was prior to the new upgrades. Took away the magnet purchase and wiped out all the magnets that were accumulated.  Also increased the cost of things 1000%. Unfortunate...On to something new.
"This game is awesome! 

I love it"
nothing i can say bad about this game. one of the cutest funny and addictive runner i have ever played.
There is now no reward given for an increase in challenge level. I'm at level 113 and there are no rewards given. Also the magnet barely show up in gameplay and when it does it is active for a short time - even though my magnet is upgraded to the fullest. Moreover you took the magnet out of the starting upgrades - wish you hadn't! I worked hard to rack up enough coins to fully upgrade the magnet and now it's taken off the chart...please bring it back. You increased the number of coins needed to revive Sheldon exponentially...it used to start off at 10 coins to revive Sheldon at the start of the game - now it's 100 coins. The coin doubler used to cost 300 coins, now it costs 3,000 coins. Not worth playing the game anymore. It's a shame.
Have played this as decompression-time for nearly a year. . . But probably won't in future. The latest update took all the fun out of the game.
This game is so fun. Too bad you can't even play cuz it keeps crashing.
"I lost 1000 coin magnets with the latest update! Can u believe that?!?
In addition to frequent crashes, power up prices are stupidly high.
Either change it back or shove it up yours!"
This was my favorite runner game. Not anymore. I just downloaded it again after a long time of not having it and I see that you can't buy magnets anymore and the coin doubles is 3,000 coins?!!!! Really? If you're gonna do that then make getting money in the game much easier. Especially that you can't even buy magnets anymore! Not pleased with this update at all.
Crashes every time less than 20 seconds into the run for ipad but works fine for iphone. a useful update would be to make the superdrop less ambiguously hard to execute.
its so much fun!!!
"This update is worse than the previous update. Why must you keep changing the mechanics of the game? Supposedly no more moles yet there they are. The coin balance is off and the challenges don't coincide with what is available in game. 

The game is messed up now."
Game crashes after 3 seconds. I also lost about 100 magnets with the new update. Magnets were the best part. Please bring them back. Not as fun.
KEEPS CRASHING!! I also lost my magnets that I have previously bought! Can't access the "upgrades" tab without the whole app shutting down! Can't even play this game anymore now after the new upgrade. PLEASE FIX!
This game was great until the latest update. Now you can't buy coin magnets and everything went up 1000% in price. 3000 coins for a coin doubler? That's ridiculous. Not really interested in playing any longer.
Was a great game and use to be a lot of fun, but now it crashes every time after a few seconds of game time. Also, it crashes when I go to purchase magnets. New challenges to collect 6000 and 5750 are stuck and impossible because of the crash and inability to use magnets.
Crashing after a few secs.
I have had this game through 2 updates. I liked the game when it first came out everything was priced good. Then the first update everything went up and I felt with it. Now it keeps crashing. Please fix NOW!! I can't even get him to run once. Someone needs to fix before I delete this.
very good
What makes me more mad then the fact that the game crashes constantly, is that when I do get it to play I see that you removed all my magnets and raised the costs on everything. You would think that as games mature they would get better. This used to be my favorite game but now I'm deleting it. Don't waste your time or money with it.
It's the awesomest game
Lo descargo por Fukuy y Alexelcapo loooooool
Great game and graphics. I keep playing for hours and hours!
Fukuy <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0081>
The title says it all, I love this game. Also if you ever have any inquiries they respond promptly and so positive and willing to help out! Thanks guys, you rock!
Me gusta la personalidad de cada conejo la maniobribilidad de la tortuga pero nose por q corre (donde esta la historia) por q tiene un trofeo?
The game was more fun before the most recent update. Some of the changes are neat but they detract from the game. Total bummer.
I don't like this update, I would like to get the past version!
The game was much more enjoyable before the update. Now the levels are more jumbled and chaotic. Though you earn more coins the increase in cost for upgrades is disproportionate. Now it's just another one of those games that constant upgrades ruined.
Stinks
This game was much better before update. Controls are slower, too many visuals (which get in the way of playing), the coin cost for boosts was increased way too much making it difficult to get enough coins to use because of all the other updates mentioned above. I loved this game before but with most of the new additions I am too annoyed to keep playing.
I do not care for the new update. One of the things is the raised prices(coins). I played this came almost every day for the challenges and to get the trunk. Even then it seemed I could never get ahead, now the magnet is $3000 when it was $250! The special updates on the wings, turbo, etc... has the prices even harder to achieve. Interested in how many other players will feel this way. Disappointed!
Buen juego seguir así
I am pretty much sure that this game is going to rock on itunes !
It's fun!
When I have to wait somewhere and need something to do this game makes the time fly by.
I like this game very nice
The most recent update detracts from the game. All the extra visuals are very distracting and the flashing coin count above Sheldons head gets confusing and leads to running into hares. Also, the coin cost of items now seems way too high. It already too an inordinate amount if time to earn enough coins to buy the costumes (even using the coin doubler and the magnet) now the cost of the doubler and magnet mean I will never have enough to get the costumes. I don't usually even have enough to get both the magnet and the doubler. Too bad because I really did enjoy the game. I will keep it and play it when another update happens to see if at the very least all the extra visual distractions are removed.
I only recently upgraded from the old original game. Here are my thoughts. The old version desperately needed a facelift, but I'm underwhelmed by the changes. I never experienced lagging in the original but now I do occasionally ( ipad2 ). The new graphics look truly amazing but I find myself losing Sheldon in the midst of it all, it appears to me that his palette has changed to less bright colors. I liked the shield gauge in the original better, too. The new controls are nice, the glide is a great addition but the smash isn't very responsive. The new levels are fun, oh, I know it's a small thing but the original coins looked better as well. The game is very fun and a great time killer but I believe I like the original a fraction more. It felt more polished to me., if I could I'd say 3.5 but not quite a 4.
It's BEEN MONTHS. And no new challenges c'mon and why take away the turbo bar with different colors
best game ever played...
Stuck at level 1 because it states I've completed all challenges. At least I still have all the power ups I earned a long time ago.
I spend way too much time on this game. Only 4 levels left to go!
Bence herkes denesin.
It's like Temple Run if temple run had a turtle running from rabbits collecting coins and bubbles and stuff. Basically it's not at all like Temple run because its awesome in its own way.  Actually it's like Run Sheldon.  Seriously though its great.
Really remember me some old time playing this game. Turtle &amp; rabbit is really so fast. The myth story of turtle &amp; rabbit…….:p. really a good time passing game.
I can’t be waiting for this time. I am very much happy to give this review. Because I love this game a lot. True Graphical Game.
that s all
Only complaint is sometimes Sheldon will glide instead of doing the power slam when you swipe down on the screen. Other than that it works pretty good and lots of fun
sorry can't right a proper review have to get back to play my game.
Run Sheldon is much fun and most importantly found the concept of the game to be pretty interesting. Sheldon is very cute and the whole game has a creative aura all over. I also like how interesting and attractive the visuals are.
I've had to restart four times on different devices because I love it so much! I love how much it has progressed, it looks amazing! Thank you.
Amazing game. Very challenging.
Good game! Small glitch with the "smash 2 hares at the same time" challenge (I've done it a ton and it doesn't clear the challenge). But really, one minor glitch and that's all I could find wrong?!?! I wish all the apps I've downloaded were created and supported by these developers!
Gg
What a nice graphic. Great visionary game I like it. Nice background music. Totally mind-blowing game………
Offers awesome graphics and exciting, fast-paced gameplay, leaving you wanting to replay the game everyday. This game deserves more 5 star reviews; should be app of the week.
"Beautifully fun game, with gorgeous graphics. It's a must DL for any iOS game fan. The developers are constantly adding new levels/missions and the app support is better than any I've ever seen....

The only suggestion I have is to add Game Center achievements. This will increase game play as well as encourage people to DL the app. Can't stress this enough..."
Awesome game. Recent updates have brought its playability to new levels and kept you interested.  The kids love it, but truth be told when they aren't around I by far play it much, much more! Love it!!
This game has smooth graphics and no crashes so far and easy control plus beautiful gameplay . It's a must play for all ages <f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008D><U+2764>
My favorite game, but the turbo boost across the top bothers me. I liked it better when it was a little shell in the left corner, and I wish it would explain things. For instance, it says for an achievement perform a power slam, but I do not know what a power slam is! Anyways, great game overall.
Superb...
"I really like this game! 
People have been talking about it for weeks and I didn't know what was going on. My fried. Told me to get it and I did! It's amazing! It's really addicting, fast pace game."
This game is so live.... I LOVE IT. There is only one word for it AWSOMEEEE!!! Ive had it for like 1 year and i never get tired of it. Get it.!
Download this game! Don't hesitate!
Mindless yet entertaining. The newer updates made the game even better.
It's addicting and fun.

I love this game I can't live with out it
I'm in love with this game I feel sick if I don't play lol especially after the updates..... But seriously gotta fix or do something about the smashing 2 at the same time I've been on level 93 for almost a month now and 3 of the challenges are the same smashing 2 please please do a new update about it please
Great game for the bathroom. Really fun.
Could you make it any more difficult? HELP
I the like game much. Play day every long time. The turtle he is the fast. I not like bunny much he kill me all time. Good game hate bunny why they put him in game kill my turtle.
I like the new revamp but it's rewards & costs are steep.  All the costs went up, leveling up gives a very small reward & every time u turn around they r asking u to buy more coins.  I refuse to spend money for coins. They were on the right track with the upgrade in game & graphics but failed with the rewards & costs
It's fun to play.
They don't want u to finish some levels so even if u complete challenge it won't show completed. Previous version was better
Very very very entertaining
It's a fun game pretty addicting to
Love it.
"This game is extremely afflicting and with the new update everything is better. One of my top favorite games that needs more recognition.

Download it you won't be disappointed."
Fun and addicting  what you want in a game !!!
Love it, love the new update. But I agree a little confusion as too what some of the terminology means. And still can't figure out what s power slam is or how to do it? Thanks.
Updates are amazing!! Can't stop playing <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0083>
The game is very good..specially after the last update!!
This game is well thought out, very addicting and fun. I love the different costumes and the challenges keep u wanting more!!! <f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008D><f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008D>UR doing it right developers!!
Its actually really fun and I like how fast everything is
Great app!!!!
This concept seems fun, but this isn't a legit review, so please don't pay attention, as I am only doing this for AppWinn.
The game is so fun to play and easy. The turtle is so cute to play and away from the rabbit.
This app is really really addicting! I had so much fun!
I love this game, so fun!
Really fun and easy to play.
This was so surprisingly fun. I will have this game forever
Overall I think this app is very fun, but I think the controls are a little clunky in game.
The update is absolute crap. The game doesn't even recognize all the challenges I've completed even after an uninstall/reinstall...such a shame.
I like to play when I am bored
Beast game gungah
The app is so much fun!
Very addicting!
Easy to play and fun
This is a great game for the children.
IT IS SOOO MUCH FUN! I LOVE THIS!
The shiznit! A lovely addition to an evening of alcohol-induced joy :)
So far from the short amount of time I have played this game it is: very fun, addicting and adventurous. Good job!
When I first got this game, I thought it would be boring but then it became addicting. I rarely write reviews for an app but for "Run Sheldon!", I have a good reason to write a review.
Very fun a exciting game
"•  •

I'm a big fan of endless running games and since this one is a little bit different than the others, i love it! Its so addicting.
This is my favorite endless runner :) you won't regret this simple yet hard game! I like the graphics and nice controls.
Seems neet.
Great game
It's nice to enjoy.
I like it but it gets boring
This is an addicting game and it is really really fun and the should make more games like this
Another temple run esk game but this one is a bit different! Absolutely love it!
Can't put down
one of the best graphics in such a small sized game, its very addicting and fun to play.
so simple yet so good
This is one of those fun, Addicting games that can be played forever. If I could I would never put down my iPad.
Great game to play .also to pass the time :)
Great game. Very addicting
This game is so much fun i just can't stop playing its that fun!!!
This a awesome app

Fun to play
I love this app sooooo much! My favorite app I own! :)
Great app I love it you won't regret getting it awesome and fun
This game is very fun and enjoyable I love it<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0084><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0084>
Nice app
I thought that this game was great and so addicting. Five stars for sure!
It's fun, very addicting, and fun for all ages.
This game is fun
This game is super addicting !!!!
-____-
It's an alright game
Cool app.
try it
This game ( in my opinion) is similar to tempel run, and many other game titles wich makes  a greater experience.
Amazing Game!!!
Fun game but I don't get the point of it. All you do is run, jump on rabbits, collects coins. It is fun if you are looking forward to beating your previous records otherwise this gAme gets boring.
Favorite.
This game is pretty fun but there are a lot of other games like this.
It's a great game and all but I just think its not for me
It's addicting
Has no lag at all, and can very addictive. Great user interface!
awesome game
What I mean by too much is that there are too many games like this
Love it!:)
The burrito guy likes to walk to stuff.
Felt a lot like temple run but it was quite addicting.
Love the animals in this app
This game is really fun and cool. I really liked how much you are allowed to customized Sheldon and it is a very easy to learn game. Although there are only 2 controls (jump and glide) i did find it a tiny bit challenging to get used to. Overall very good game! 5 stars!
Running games were starting to become a bit bland, but this was interesting as it is a side-scroller. Overall, it's a fun and easy game. Runs smoothly.
It's one of thoses games you can just sit there and play while time flys.
Love this game. Very fun and challenging.
I would literally buy this game for 100 dollars it is that good I highly recommend this game for geeky app gamers.
I want to keep playing.
Good to pass some time. Very easy to learn and play
Cool way to kill time and has great graphics!
This game is pretty cool
I love this game its very addicting
really good
I really love this game, is sooooo addictive !!!!! amazing game
Nice app
Addicting
Simple, yet fun and addicting!
It's a fun game but sometimes takes a while to load when I start a new game.
Try it out
this game was very fun and ecxiting
this gamewas very fun and exciting
U can keep playing for a long time. A great game if u want to kill some time
I like the game, it is pretty interesting.
Great app
"My children love this game! 
My daughter Christina Catherine Claussenb"
Very fun but update broke the game :(
Great app to have some fun
This is a great app it is very addicting to play I recommend it to everyone.
Very fun game! :)
Great
Really addictive
I have a blast playing this.
Fun to run with Sheldon
I love this game it's so addicting
It's a lot like Mega Run, but in a good way. Very fun!!!
"Update was much needed to control or character a lot better. 

Now we just need a tutorial for new people so they know about the power slams and turbo boosts."
So fun but very addict ing haha
Game is very entertaining and runs well!
"The new update is nice...
Surely a must have game!"
Run Sheldon is a fun game! Very neat idea, fun to play!
I really like this game, its simple and really fun!
It was really fun but once I updated the app it started crashing
I could probably run faster than Sheldon, but nice game anyways.
This game is really fun and addicting game
The game was alright ithey could've added more to the game.
Good
This is a good app if you have little children that want to play this game! It's fun, easy, and easy to learn!
I loved the game before the update. Now the terminology is all weird and I don't know what half the challenges mean! I wish I'd never gotten the update. I liked the old one better. But the graphics are good!
Great for entertainment for little kids!!
Easy game and a good running game.
Nice app
Best game in the App Store... PERIOD
Before the update it was better
This game was great before, but now it is awesome. The latest update has made the graphics that much better.  I highly recommend this game.
I like this game bcuz it is so easy but fun at the same time.
So confused about challenges now since the update but I still love it but what is a power slam
Muy bonito juego, tienen algún tips no puedo avanzar del nivel 32 :(
Just amazing..
Really not liking the new update....
It ok now that I'm update it
Nice game but somtimes the nedded things to level up its un understandable
Don't like costumes nor the turbo which is the same as the blue starter. Miss the rocket when I want it not when I POW enough bunnies than get an unexpected boost. It messes with where I'm at. Cost too much coins so your not able to continue on. Poor Sheldon is working harder in this new version and not able to get ahead. Clearly it's about getting you to spend more money to get to the next round. Miss the extra lives. The boost and upgrades cost double than last time.
I loved this game to begin with, but after the latest update, I've fallen in love all over again! Excellent work!
I absolutely love the new stuff, but unfortunately the app has crashed tons of times since I got the update :/
I wished i never updated it. If there wasnt an update it would have been 10 stars!
This game is pretty sweet and very addicting. It's simple, but I can play it for hours.
"The game has gotten way better since the last update but around 8000m it starts getting laggy and slows down and you end up losing. 

Also the amount u have to pay for keeping going jumps from 60 coins to 100k and that just seems like a huge amount that isn't possible. It would be nice if you fixed these few things and the game would get 5 starts from me."
Este es uno de los mejores juegos que he jugado
Muy buen juego pero es muy pero muy parecido al Jetpack igual es muy entretenido
5 stars!!!!
I love this game it's fun and entertaining!
5
This game is really fun, and the graphics are really good. I can't stop playing this game, and it's driving me crazy!
Love, love, love this game. I am on level 31 and still addicted.  Play it every night.
I absolutely love this game!! It's super addicting. But, I've found since the last update, at times it's been slow and Sheldon won't jump when I tap the screen all the time and it doesn't accurately count some of the challenges (i.e smash 30 hares in one run) I love this game! Hopefully the next update will fix these issues :)
I cannot stop playing.
I love this game but I think a few changes would make it better. 1.) there should be a grace period from when you bounce off one rabbit to the time you touch the ground to keep from dying in mid air. 2.) instead of only having one turtle she'll at the bottom there should be more that you can purchase. 3.) have more power ups and more upgrades.
Addictive. Simple and challenging.
easily the best game i've played in a while... the game itself is simple but power ups, and abilities add complexity in the game, which i  love. i give 100 points out of 100!
Because it's cute and fun! Sheldon is the most adorable turtle ever. Great game 5/5
Great graphics, user interface, design, gameplay... it may as well beat Angry Birds... besides being unbelieveably fun, I'd rather see Sheldon mugs instead of Angry bird dolls... seriously, they are getting annoyingly old
Gotta say, they did a good job with the graphics. The game is amazingly addicting, I recommend it to everyone.
I love the game but after one run, the app closes and I have to wait for it to load again. Other then that PERFECT!
"Run Sheldon is a must have game. It is what is next when it comes to gaming. The story is a take on The Tortoise and The Hare, one of my favorite fables. I love games that have solid storylines, and Run Sheldon is one of them. The game introduces the player to Sheldon, an adorable turtle that must defeat some overzealous rabbits. 

The graphics are excellent and the game is very addicting. Run Sheldon reminds me of the games I loved playing growing up. Run Sheldon is the kind of game that kids and adults of all ages can enjoy playing together or alone. If you are anything like me you will find yourself playing Run Sheldon at every spare moment you have during the day. Lots of fun and very good as a stress reliever! I would recommend Run Sheldon to anyone who is looking to find the next fun and addictive game!"
Awesome game and graphics are amazing, the game is so addictive and well designed. Off to play some more.
Almost every app I have is something I paid a buck for and played with once. This game is so much fun, and didn't cost a thing. I wish there were more like this. The artwork is great - fun and bright. It's simple enough that my niece who is nine can play it, but I play it nonstop at the same time. I downloaded it a month ago and I'm still not done with it, as there's just a ton to do in it. I just hope next update lets us customize the colors or scenes or something.
This is the best game I've ever downloaded in app store. It's kind of a millennium version of mario but it's much more better than that! I lose the track of time when I play it!!!
">First Impressions
My first impression of Run Sheldon was pleasant, there was a good background  introduction into why Sheldon the turtle is on the run. The menu screen then greets you with a cute and fluid animation. Other than that there are facebook and twitter options.

>Gameplay
The game is similar to that of jimmy jetpack and temple but this game is unique in many aspects. You have the control of the jump action of the character  and you go about avoiding evil hares and collecting coins. The more coins you collect the better. Unlike other games Run Sheldon does not restart the level every time you run into evil hares which is actually a good thing as it allows you to go further into the game. On the other hand the amount of coins get deducted every time an evil hares touches you. The further you go the more coins get deducted.

>Unique Features
Run Sheldon allows you  swim, fly and glide when you collect the respective power up and disappears when you hit an enemy which is quite cool and breaks the monotony. 

>Overall
I enjoyed playing Run Sheldon, I definitely recommend getting this game. It is really fun to play and the variety keeps the game playable for many runs to come."
This is a great game for all ages. Loved the classic idea of turtle. It's an all around adorable game that is addicting! The power ups are a nice addition to the game too.
I love the variety in the levels in this game.  Multiple levels, water hazards and even flying come in to play and add to the fun.  Great game.
Mine is crashing. So, I can never play it.
Played for hours, didn't want to stop!
Soo addictive! Such a great way to pass the time. It's my fave game on my iPad. I think everyone would like it, and I love the music.
This game is really awesome. Me and my girlfriend got addicted to it within minutes and want to outrun each other. It took me a while to get that the aim of the game is to run as many miles as possible and not collect as many coins as possible ....
"This game is the best!! Before the play long hours, this is my favourite!!
Super Recommend!!"
I like the idea of the game, its so addictive, fun and easy to play. I could spent hours of playing with its beautiful animations, graphics and sounds. The app deserve a full five stars from me.
So much fun! My son is absolutely in love with the graphics.
This game is so fun and cute!
As a little turtle you are running through the forest collecting coins and other items that will give you special abilities such as flying! The best part is, that if you've collected enough coins you can keep playing where you left off! I love this game and play for hours!!
I really enjoy the art style and the intuitive controls. The power ups and level layout increase the difficulty at a good rate. Perfect for a quick play but can easily pull you in for extended sessions. :)
The game is so addicting and hard to put down. There are a bunch of different environments to go through and upgrades for abilities with coins. Graphics are also amazing!
Very awesome game, this game will be hot in next time, I really like it
First off let me say that this game is very addictive, I can't seem to put it down. The gameplay is simple but effective and I love the seamlessly endless power-ups possibilities. Thanks for a great game!
Game is finally fixed for us with the slower devices!! Thanks for not just ignoring us! You guys are awesome!!
Very good
Awesome game! In the next update, you should let us change the color of Sheldon's shell! ;)
Pretty cool
Sheldon is pretty fast for a turtle… but game is awesome!
The graphics are great, the concept it's similar to other games but its ok you can spend hours playing :) it's
Love this game. It's awesome. Can't stop playing it! Must defeat the bunnies!
Love this game it's fantastic it's a Must play game... !!!
The jumping hares are adorable on their new outfits but impossible to smush now!  Aargh!  Everything else is fabulous!  I love Sheldon!!!!!
Love this game but in the most recent version released, the jump counter is not accurate. When trying to achieve a jump challenge, the game does not properly recognize all of your jumps. Please fix this!
Awesome game
I like the game but every time I die the game crashes. Never saves how far I've gone in the game. It's always the same number when I start back up again even if I've gone further in the previous game. Fix this please!
Zu langsam!! Aber en lustiges spiel
Ya i think this game is preety good but it would be bettter if you fixed a few things like junping takes to mcuh of a delay , when i land a hare i somehow die and MOST IMPORTANT FIX the MONEY system it tskes wayyyyyy to much money for an upgrade either make money worth more ormake the upgrades be worth less like really just the second upgrade cost like 35,000. Thats insane
After the latesf update game is way slower and looks like my ipod (5 gen) can't handle it ', before this update it worked really great and I was playing it for a really long time, but right now I'm waiting for another update.
I love the game. Spent many hours playing. However I'm having the same problems some users have stated below. I'm also stuck on level 32 because of the mega rocket challenge. I have gotten two rockets in one run multiple times but the challenge won't clear. It still says 0/2 rockets used. I would recommend the game but many issues including game controls need to be upgraded.
I played this game many times and sometimes I purchase the magnets or double the coins it took my money but never gave me my stuff
I like the game, but it is crap because you can't play it. The turtle should be more to the left so that you know what is coming at you. Please repair the game
I love playing this game. It's simple and fun. I love it!!!
This is a fun, addictive game with great graphics. Runs smoothly on my iPad. But it can be really infuriating when you watch Sheldon helplessly fall right into a bunny and there's nothing you can do about it. Make the controls better! Also, the boosts and upgrades are way too expensive!
Good game but disappointing once you get to the third world. Come on, after level 3 the amount of coins you have to spend goes up thousands even hundreds of thousands from levels 1 & 2. It's clear that the makers are only interested in profit. At least make it fair and gradually increase the coins you have to spend. You'll keep more players, get better reviews, and still have buyers who will purchase 25,000 coins for 99 cents once they get to a crazy good level. Rework this strategy and you'll see results. I'm tempted to delete the game because of this.
Good game
Its a good game but when i lose it wont let me replay. It will just kick me out the game so thats needs to get fixed.
But we really need better controls. The controls with the bubble should be used for Sheldon too.
This is an awesome endless runner game. The tortoise & the hare - a story we can all relate to. But the hares are ganging up on poor Sheldon the tortoise. Will he win this time? Only you can tell! Love it!!
Wow!! I really like this game. Great graphics and gameplay. Great backstory that everyone can relate to. I really appreciate the pause and hints while I'm playing the first time. The challenging course keeps me engaged. This game is AWESOME! 5 stars!
"I would've gave this game 5 stars but whenever you are about to die it takes way too many coins that you earned to replay again or start back at ground zero the powerups cost too much. A GOOD GAME GONE TO WASTE 

WASTE YOUR LIFE WAITING TO UPGRADE COINS"
It's a great game-highly addictive. The only problem I have is when Sheldon gets hit by a bunny it's not always the same price to get a second chance. It fluctuates.
Kept launching safari to open facebook, after every race!!!!
This is a great endless runner! The only problem I have is it seems like he takes too long to come back down after he jumps. I think it would be easier to play if he fell to the ground faster. Other than that its a fantastic game!
This is the best game ever, but I gave it <f0><U+009F><U+008C><U+009F><f0><U+009F><U+008C><U+009F><f0><U+009F><U+008C><U+009F><f0><U+009F><U+008C><U+009F>because Sheldon doesn't jump when I want him, like right after you kill a rabbit.
Addicting and fun!! Keep it coming Sheldon, those rabbits won't get away! <f0><U+009F><U+0090><U+00A2><f0><U+009F><U+0090><U+00A2><f0><U+009F><U+0090><U+00A2><f0><U+009F><U+0090><U+00A2><f0><U+009F><U+0090><U+00A2><f0><U+009F><U+0090><U+00A2><f0><U+009F><U+0090><U+00B0><f0><U+009F><U+0090><U+00B0><f0><U+009F><U+0090><U+00B0><f0><U+009F><U+0090><U+00B0><f0><U+009F><U+0090><U+00B0>
This game is epic - specially this is the only game i've ever on appstore so far that doesn't start over every time.
This game is great, though sometimes Sheldon doesn't jump when I want him to. Though that's just it, five stars!
Lets play very interesting game
My sister has this app on her iPod and it is VERY fast , but the app on my iPhone 4s is VERYYY slow. I cant even enjoy it like I do on her iPod :(
I have a problem with this app on iphone 5 . The app shuts off !!!!!!!!!
"I love this game but everytime I finish a run the app shuts off and nothing is saved.
Please fix this to make it better"
I'd give it 5 stars if it played at normal speed. I have this on my iPad & the family loves it but on my iPhone 4 it's just too slow to be enjoyable.
Please fix the slowness for the iPhone 4 because its so boring with it being so slow
I love this game. Sheldon is so cute! The game almost never freezes for me. The only things I would add are some accessories or something extra like that. Keep up the good work!
"The power ups don't amount to anything in this game. You spend coins collected to buy them, but end up making less after using them..?
I'm not sure how that works.

If you wanted people to feel unaccomplished, then you succeeded.
I'm not paying real money for ""coins."" They don't seem to be worth much.

Btw, the upgrades are terrible.
Take a look at what Mega Run did. Do that, and this game will be golden."
This app is so fun but its in slow motion for me all the time please fix
Very rich scenery. Really fluid, great gameplay.
"Only 4 because it wont save the game process after call answered.
Rejecting everyone till u guys update..."
I have this on my 3GS and on my iPhone 4 and I did a comparison for graphics and gameplay my 3GS runs this game on full speed but on the iPhone 4 it lags please fix this fun game though.
Nice game
good game and very fun too.
The game is fun to play and full of surprises. Amazing graphics.
Liked the game.
My name is Sheldon creepy man =|
I like it though
Is so funny game, but I wish that support achievement in Game Center please
My coin doubler isn't working.  Lost out on at least a couple thousand coins because of that.  SLooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooow and lags.
I'm addicted to this game!! I think it should be number one!
I would give the game 5 stars but I played one round of the game, and then during the 2nd round it crashed and the game started over. Tried again, same exact thing happened. And then again, and again, and again, and again. Great game because its really fun. But I don't feel like starting the game over during every 2nd round
This game is amazing and totally addictive but I have no idea how to or what it means when it says to "use a heart." If anyone knows please put it up cause its driving me crazy!
This is by far the best runner type game. Graphics are awesome, music is good, just an all around fun game, and it gets challenging as you keep going. Thank you to the developers for coming up with this game! Great!
Really fun game but glitchy after 10 minutes. Gets slow and doesn't recognize taps on the screen. End up wasting my time dying because of the delay. Need an update to fix that.
"Muy buen juego, entretenido, buena calidad de imagen, muy bueno..
Felicitaciones al creador!"
Simply a beautiful game. So much fun and a great challenge as well. I could play this for hours at a time.
This game is way too much fun!
This is probably the most fun game app I own. I will complain though that the jumping should be faster because when you jump over one rabbit, and there's another, then, you're dead! You also don't jump very high even when you hold it in and I think those things should be fixed. But other than those things this game is awesome!
Power-ups are way to overpriced..bought upgrade 1/5 for 4000 finally, and then the second upgrade goes up to 20k??? Also pretty pointless buying magnet or coin doubler when in the end you'll make as much as if u didn't buy those
I really like this game, it's quite fun.
The game is not responsive in terms of the time between your touch and the jump.
Extremely addicting!!
"It works Perfect on iPhone 5 I loved it .
Amazing Animations. 
This game is awesome !"
It really has my fingers attached to it! Lol
Rabbits are too aggressive and it's a bit hard to jump on the mushrooms but, the story, which reminds me of my childhood memories, is too cute and the character design is awesome. I can't say I'm a gamer, but I'm definitely keeping this installed on my iPhone...
This is a addicting game and I can't stop playing it . U won't regret downloading this game
Awesome game. GO TURTLES!
But fun
You should fix jump speed. it is too slow between two jumping. waiting for updates. But nice job <f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008D>
Nice
This game is awesome; nice use of a classic tale, great graphics and overall fun fun fun!!!!!
It's reaction after one jump to another is pretty difficult and the prices of the power ups are ridiculously high! I had this game for a while now and I still haven't been able to afford a level 2 power up!
Fun but slow! Every time I jump over one bunny then to the next, the turtle wont jump, slows down and makes me lose.
I hope it will be better when comes to the updates
Fun but way to slow!!!!!
Great app and fun
Really fun game! I downloaded it because the turtle has the same name as me but, it turned out to be really fun! Only one problem, though. The hit box on the running and jumping hares with mud one their ears and body is WAY to big. Even if I don't get close, I die.
Would be better if it didn't move so slow fix this please
This is an awesome game!!! But, it would be better if there were costumes or different shells to wear. Also it would be cool if you could play as other characters. Please add these things I would really appreciate it. :)
This game has the potential to be a fun game but its just so slow on my phone any body know how to fix this ?
This game is a great way to pass the time. It's entertaining and will keep you busy for hours. I like it because you don't have to log back in every 30 minutes and collect anything, it's just load and play
run, run!)
Its reeally fun
Best game i have played in a long time
"The graphics are great but that's as far as it goes. It takes SO long to upgrade any power up (it's a turtle. He runs slow. He doesn't deserve the trophy when running that slow). And the jumping is just too slow. It's hard to be accurate.

And when you die you can pay with coins to keep going... But they take away the counter that tells how many you've earned for that board. They only show you your total. Cuz when you see that you've only accrued 71 coins, keep going for 40 seems dumb. This game is stupid. I'm over it."
<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008F>
This app is awesome. The development team obviously put down lots of effort in it. The graphics are beautiful, the animations are sleek, and it surprises me that the turtle can make noise when he jumps. Love the app!
Great game but it should have like a multiplayer mode to play with you're friends
Really fun game and great graphics!
It's a really good game with good graphics and a good-simple story...I like every concept in the game, It's really cool to play...But you should fix that, Every time i finish a run, It asks me if i want it to let it post on my facebook, I denied, And after the next run...It asks me again!

Run Sheldon is a different game from all others, it's about a turtle who is being chases by evil rabbits. There chasing him cause they want his trophy. Yeah I know it's weird but its also cool. The only thing is that why is he so slow? All the App Store needs to do is make him faster and make him Jump higher cause I always die:( Run Faster Sheldon!!!
This is a really fun game for all ages :)
A good time-killing game. I can see myself getting tired of it in a few weeks.
I suggest you guys to download this game :D because it is so fun!
Omg :D i love this game!
I play this game when i am boring most and it is so addictive and awesome :D
This game is so enjoyable :)
I really enjoy playing this game :D
I love this game!
My game runs slow :( and the magnet stopped working but it still takes my coins
This is really not all that fun. U only played for like two games and I deleted it. I would suggest buying it even though it was free.
"I really like this game. It's cute, fun and addictive. There's only two things which I would improve on , and that would be one being the jump. It would be better if when Sheldon jumped he didn't stay in the air for so long because that makes it difficult to kill the heirs, sometimes you just jump past them or get killed and it's annoying. Two being maybe adding check points ! I get that it's like temple run but you can always be original and add a little something :) check points would be a great touch ! It would help a lot . Overall, it's worth downloading 
+ free !!!"
"Run Sheldon is one of the best iPhone games available if not the greatest. It is simple amazing. The graphics are completely beautiful and the gameplay is addicting. I can't put my phone down even after hours of playing!!

The boosters make the game even funner when I achieve them and get all the bonuses. I also love how it's integrated with Game Center cuz I can play with all my friends and challenge.

All in all this is an amazingly beautiful and addicting game. Run Sheldon run!!"
I can't believe the five-star reviews aren't fake. This is a complete waste of time that only exists to try to sell you in-app coins. Perhaps you would enjoy it if you are, in fact, a tortoise.
It fun with easy play.
So much fun! Great game for the whole family.
This adorable game is fun and awesome. And it's free!
"Is it possible to create a running game more addicting than Temple Run?  The answer is a resounding YES!  First off, the colors in this game are amazing.  The animation is great and the game play is super-smooth.  This would be catchy for even younger players, and the music and sound effects provide a nice background.  

It took me a couple tries and quick deaths to get the hang of it, but caught on quickly.  Early on, I recommend not using any Boosts or Power-ups and just getting the hang of collecting coins and stomping on bunnies.  When you first start playing, don’t spend your coins on regeneration—just get the experience of playing and you’ll be hooked quickly!

If you need any inspiration to keep going, work on collecting coins for Power-ups for more productive runs.  Also, you can start working on completing challenges to pass through the levels.  Have fun exploring all the game has to offer.  If I were you, I’d get this while it’s free, because this is much better than many pay runner apps out there."
To start off with this game looks great, it's colorful and good graphics. It's addictive and you will spend many hours running from rabbits. Over all one of the best free games on App Store.
One of the best free games I have downloaded lately!  Great graphics & fun for my son & I!
Really neat opening story with Sheldon the turtle! Reminds me of angry birds in a way with how fun the graphics are. Lots of fun to play between class!
Good time waster
The animations and graphics are sweet eye candy...The game is easy to pick up, yet challenges you the more you play which is what I like. After playing, I thought it was fun and very engaging. This is the type of game that's hard to put down. Great job!!!
I love it. It is one of the best apps I have ever played.
Just because the game is about a tortoise doesn't mean it has to move as slowly. I am now eligible for social security. Thank you Sheldon.
5 <f0><U+009F><U+008C><U+009F> for sure
It's like Temple Run if temple run had a turtle running from rabbits collecting coins and bubbles and stuff. Basically it's not at all like Temple run because its awesome in its own way.  Actually it's like Run Sheldon.  Seriously though its great.
or "Dalton 2"
You're going to have lots of fun with it. :)
Good concept, funny characters and nice graphics, but single-tap control is not designed well and doesn't give you enough control over your character. On the other hand, side-scrolling is not smooth and you usually have no idea where your enemies are and even if you see them, you can do nothing except jumping over or on them.
You can actually do everything with the ingame money unlike other games, when you die you actually use the in-game money to revive.... Not some secondary credits, coins, gems etc....
The graphics are great, the concept it's similar to other games but its ok you can spend hours playing :) it's <f0><U+009F><U+0086><U+0093>, so download <U+2B07>
Love it!! It is like a different version of angry birds.
Bence herkes denesin.
Marvelous! I said o another temple run. Buuut, it is really entertaining new dimension. Temple run I get bored in 2-3 plays. This is always keeps your attention. Nice product. Keep up the goos work.
I am not a gamer but i really love this game. Good work. Congratulations
I think this game is better than super mario. I love the turtle so cute. Where can I order the stuffed animal?
really fun and beautiful graphics
Awesome game concept and ultra creative vision. Please tweak the controls so you can swipe down to control the descent of your jump.
Wow this is a really good game. Looks great on ipad 3 and is very fun to play. If you like endless runners then you will love this.
Why aren't people reviewing this awesome game
"There are so many games out there - and I've tried many.
Run sheldon is colorful , simple and addictive. Definitely one of my favourites."
Very addictive from the moment you start playing. Just wish it had an instruction menu to remind you of the moves available and how to use the various functions
Good app
Hi
Not bad for when you are bored
This. Game is very good and deserves more downloads
Very addicting and well made game!!
It is a good game
Awesome game!
This is a very fun game to play. Only complaint is It is a little clunky. Other than that it's a very good.
FUN & ADDICTIVE!!
Fun game to play
Very addicting
Amazing game with an intuitive control scheme and beauitful garphics.
"It is very interesting and enjoyable to play

Thanks for app developer"
Love the concept behind the game. My little girl loves to challenge her cousins on Game Center. Is yet to tire of it which is saying something! Plenty of variety with power ups and speedy waterfalls. Graphics are great too.
Great time waster however I found that when sometimes when I'm using two boosts together, one of them doesn't work. This has happened a few times already and the most annoying time was when it didn't work three games in a row! Please fix this bug.
This is a mix between Jetpack Joyride and a turtle game!!!! Awesome game
Can't wait for your next awesome games this is amazing!!!!! <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0084><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0084><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0084><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008D><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008D><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008D><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0098><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0098><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0098>
"It's an addictive game, loves it. Some minor bugs needs to be fixed.
Excellent customer support !"
Man! This game is excellent!!!! SOOOO AWESOME <f0><U+009F><U+0099><U+0089><f0><U+009F><U+0099><U+0089><f0><U+009F><U+0099><U+0089>
Only just got this game and I am already fixated to it, to anyone that gets bored with a game really quickly, this is the game for you it will keep you consumed all day !!!!!!!!!! GET THIS GAME :D
This game is so much fun to play even my whole family play it. My kids are playing it non stop and never get bored. This is must have game for your kids and you and even whole family. Great game guys
they know how to keep people on the road show!!
Nice app has a good feel to it.
Awesome game but after a while a playing it doesn't count challenges. Need 2 mega rocket in one go... Doesn't count them. Finish running 40,000m doesn't give you new challenge. Needs some work
Very good gamme but turtle should not die straightway atleast give more powers to use in game
Highly addictive and very fun, can play over and over again
Best game I never have enough of this game who ever made this game keep up the good work
I can't see the background story for the cards but the buttons are a bit too small for me which is a bigger problem. I'm using an iPod touch, not an iPad.
Please revert the changes made in the new update! The new look is quite frankly dreadful, the layout for PC doesn't work for mobile!
I love this game I spent more then £400 on this app I love it
I strongly recommend this game due to the fact of home much enjoyment you get out of it therefore I give urban rivals 5 stars!
Using iOS 5, can't even launch this app. Same as Fanatsy Rivals. Complete heap of... Crashes on start.
Would rate more if the game didn't crash upon opening.
Why no iPad app?
Rubbish don't wast your time :(
I remember the UR site a few years ago when I signed up. So much has changed and I really think the app is getting a bit out dated. Mainly because the market is very awkward but also because of the lack of slots and the home page. I love UR it's an amazing fun game that is brilliant for passing time but it's worth spending a bit of time booting up your computer to play it on if possible. Anyway it's an amazing app that needs slight updating. Btw nightmare gheist decks are fun xP
The games fun and exciting, but it's needs a couple more tweaks, needs to be reformatted for iPhone and iPad, also you can't even buy cards with Clintz unless someone's selling them, I remember when you could purchase fresh packs with Clintz instead of only just Credits, but like I said it's still fun and entertaining, just could be better.
Its been years since i last played the game on my pc i had the greatest cards i spent so mutch time and i just found an app for saddly i cannot rember my old account with my awsome decks ohwell
Lovely graphics, and a perfect take for mobile, but adding the slot machine and an offline mode would make it pefec
Can you fix a bug that says it can't connect with Facebook plz
As a game I've played for so long on the PC, I was a little sceptical about it becoming an app. However, I was pleasantly surprised. It's even more addictive and still great fun.
Best app ever.
I will give it 5 stars if the game included a offline mode :)
Awesomeness is the only word. DON'T listen to 1* reviews. They don't know what they're talking about. :D
can u make an option to turn off the VS

"Nice little game that continues to please

Very clean user interface and the game has lots of potential for *very* long term play. There are a lot of things to do, various ways to play, missions to complete.

One negative thing: the art on many of the cards is now looking very dated. Would be great if those few could be redone. Example: Brandon, Bob Joby, most of the Junkz are quite frankly awful by anyone's standards."

There are too many games like this on the App Store, it's ridiculous.

It's a scam do not download
Hi, you said I could get 1000 followers, please give them to me on JackMossInHD
Fab game! Even got my sister to download it! Deffo worth a download! Are you still doing shout outs on Instagram? You commented on my photo this morning x
Amazing game love it now were mys 1000 instant followers on Instagram?
Why can't I sell my characters???????????? Why do I need to buy in app purchases .
I use this game as something to help my stress-filled life, if i have a break in work i will play this, it is very addicting and a brilliant idea for a game, the only thing i could think of to make it better would be something like a daily gift of clintz then after 5 days you get a free credit or another card or something along those lines
This game promises Instagram followers but I don't see how that works!? Felling very cheated :(
This game advertising more followers on Instagram but I don't know how that works
Keeps crashing
It's a good game and all, but what does it have to do with Instagram?
Fantastic! Easy to use and just like the computer version
Simply fantastic, easy interface, great game, must have for anyone!!
I like it
Addictive game!!
Maybe it woald be better if we could get a decent amount of clients after a battle like 200 or 100 it's really frustrating please add this in next update
Great app! Download now <f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008D>
I thought that the app version of this game would be bad but it's exactly the same as the website version I also like the fact that you can buy credits from here because when I'm on holiday I can easily buy credits instead of going to an Internet cafe. Overall a great app.
It's a really good game but it won't let me update the new version and is stopping me from playing
All I know is that I am having fun while playing this game! Very entertaining! Great job!
I really recommend this game for gamers! It has easy controls and great environment! Totally addicting and very engaging!
Whenever I don’t do anything I just grab my phone and play this cool app. Each character where cool!
This game rocked my world; I am so addicted with this game! I can play it anytime I want!
This app comes handy and when I get bored I can grab my phone and start playing! Thanks!
This game is very challenging yet gave me satisfaction. I would definitely purchase more of this game!
I play this game every day and it doesn’t fail me to be entertained! Great!
I can customize my own players and fight against my rivals!
I love this game but with the update it crashes straight away ! You need to fix it!
The game was good whilst it lasted however if you take a break and forget your login then you can't get it back. The game also sends you constant emails and there is no way to recover your password which means you have to start again without a login anyway so if they were to add a recovery feature it wouldn't help anyway. Very disappointed! 2 stars.
Best trading card game out by far! Would highly recommend to anyone!
It won't start downloading but I had it before and it was quiet good,, can someone help me cuz I wanna play it ;((((
I is a good game but it takes forever to build up enough clints to buy the cards. An there should be a way to play against your friends instead of just hoping they r in the same room as u. Apart from that the actuall game itself is good and easy to understand
Very very addictive dofo recommend
It's taken me for hours to try and find how to play the solo game and I still don't know how to do it . Help ????
It won't let me buy credits, it says the transaction has already been made but it hasn't. Really needs an update <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008A>
It is epic!
wont recognise log in info and wont allow regisration(says name is in use) do not download
Good game! They needs to be an update for clans though
"This app is awesome but not as good as it could be. iPad support should be included. Also as mentioned it should try and capture the rest of the game forums, chat rooms and slot machine. I have played this on Pc, droid and iPhone/pad the iPhone app is so much smoother than the droid version but does not cover as much.

Awesome app / game but please update iPad retina please :)"
"I have been playing this game for some time now, and it is very good, but playing on an iPhone just doesnt give the same experience as playing on the computer. The great online community is not captured in this version, and so this app is mainly for people who play on the computer aswell.

Also please bring back the earning credits button!!!"
Fantastic game do you think you can make a few more games like this though
"It's a good game. It's free, and it's really awesome to see all your characters rank up, and look awesome.
The fact that each of the characters have different descriptions, means it builds and intricate storyline which can keep you amused for many hours"
Doesnt let u buy credits
Very epic game get it now it's free
I can't get the game
Seems very simple strategy at first, but lots of bluff and skill involved as well as deck making skills. For those asking various questions about cards and reel spins and such, go to the urban rivals website- the game was apparently available to play a long time before the app came out, same login applies and syncs up your cards and stats with the app
I logged out and now I can't log back in. E-mailed the developers for help but got no reply.
I buy cards but I can't use them:s? They don't show up while playing?
Awesome trading card game. But please sort it out for the iPad.
Ui and gameplay are spot on! Perfect addition to an already unbelievable game!
Really wish this game could be HD for ipad aswell
Shame as love this style of game. Book of heros is one of my fav' apps so was hoping to get another like that<f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008E>
Best game ever on computer
Great game. Easy & fun. But they need to make it easier to earn clatzzz
Really quite obsessed with this game!
The best card game app.
How do you spent your reels token?
I love this game but they need to make it easier to get clintz.
I think I like it :D $$$$
I must admit I don't like things like pokemon so I wasn't sure about this game but I was not dissapointed it is amazing brilliant cards game styles and tournaments those who say it's to hatd to get credits then work for it that's the point great game 10/10 get it and enjoy!
Very addictive! Outstanding illustrations
Really good and really addicting and is very good for a free app but to make it perfect could you make the money easier to get :)
Give it a go you will love it
Totally outstanding game with superb graphics. To get the good cards you have to spend money which is quite annoying.
Good game but crashes all the time
It tries to match you with similar players which takes forever, and when you do finally get into a game, it's a complete mid-match (which is odd since its supposed to be a fair match up) I keep winning bonuses which cant be used such as draw cards. And lastly, you have to spend real money because actual prize money is rediculously low u cannot do anything with it.
Good game but kinda ruined because you can barely do anything on the iPhone, like prize draw tickets especially, definately 5* if you change this though
Best of it's kind
Im loving the game. The best trading card app ever. The only problem is there are so many characters, i cant sort through to find the ones i can aford. Other
Good game save up them token things and get the best pack u will own I did lol <U+E415><U+E057><U+E105><U+E409><U+E402><U+E40C><U+E11A><U+E10C><U+E00E>
but new cards would be nice
its an amazing game but adter the update not much left to say.. originally its a 5* but atm its inle 2*.
I tries to purchase game credits for 70p it took the money and gave the credits i purchased a card pack but no cards... Good game though
Was a brilliant game loved it but now it won't load. You click on the urban rivals icon it goes onto the first bit for about 5 seconds then swicthes off. I've tried it over and over again and I've tried uninstalling and installing again but it still won't work. Please fix!!!
"was a fantastic game before the update, even better now you can buy credits on the i phone, and earn free ones by downloading free games......mezzin, get it, you wont be disappointed.

After iOS 5 update, seems to be you now can't pick cards or change decks or buy cards or sell...fix ASAP. And also the free credits have gone too :(

Yaaayyyyyy updated very quickly when they realised, well done UR devs. Awesome game again :)"
"Great game, have worked up to level 40
Shame about the removal of free credits
Gets 2 stars now as recent update left me without ability to change my deck, buy/sell cards - real own goal well done chaps"
"Wtf went wrong?!
I updated the app and ever since I can't do anything!!!
I can't upgrade my characters or arrange my deck or even go on the market to buy a card!!!!!
Not impressed!!!"
The update appears to have seriously damaged the app, as said below alot of the functionality has been lost, this is especially annoying as you cannot sell characters quickly which when you buy packs with real money to make trades and in game currency is really not good!
Amazing!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Wow, just Wow, This game is amazing. I played this for hours and have now built my characters up to such a high level. This game is well worth the download. Its Free after all and so much fun.
"Great game, but I'm lv12 and still won't let me enter fight type 1 or 2. 

And the lottery thing, fix these and it's bag on, especial for a freebie ( tho I have paid 69p for some more cards )"
Download free apps for more credits, great game design and interface, addictive levelling system and fights
"To use prize draw tickets u:
1. Go to app 
2. Go down to website
3. Go to the original website
4 there should be a bit were it says prize draw on the left.
5. Go on it!!"
I don't know how to use the prize draw tickets I earnt
Brilliant game. Started playing it on iPhone then started on pc. Please make an update and add single player like on pc please!!!!
Some glitches need patching like having no deck then unlocking cards and can't apply them to the deck. Then saying I'm disconnected even though I have full connection to my wifi.
Very good game but pleeeease Add in the prize draw tickets On app!
A very addictive game :)LMAO
"Some things I'd like in the next update:

- completely in landscape mode instead of having to rotate every time you finish and start a battle
- reduction on prices, a jump from £2.00 to a much higher price is way too expensive."
"Great app, no problems:
- if u want to buy characters go to collection u can buy em from there
- if u want to change rooms go to players and click the question Mark
- if u want to get credits use tapjoy!!!

What could possibly be wrong with this it's just majorly awesome"
this game is as good as on computer but you should be able to play music and access the lottery thing
Fantastic game but credits are way too expensive, if they was cheaper or more for your money I'd buy loads..... Other than that great.....
"Consistent crashing.
No offline mode.
Doesn't allow you to play your own music while you play.
You don't get anything good unless you pay literally a fortune. (£45+, $80+)"
"This game is great you can argue about that but this app has a few things that are missing. Such as :
- the market : you can't buy or sell anything, you can only look at what you've sold and bought.
- the rules : you can't look at the rules or how urban rivals works if you have forgotten what ELO for exemple.
What I'm trying t say is that thebwebsite is great but the app doesn't have everything that the website has so you are oblied to go on your computer once in a while to check things that you can't check on the app."
"I had this game on my laptop for a long time, and when I saw it on the app store I just had to download it. 
This game is so simple and addicting that I've found myself losing track of time whilst playing. To me, that means it's a very good game. Highly recommend. 10/10 you won't regret the download!!!"
Truly amazing TCG, no other words for it.
iv only had this app for 2 days and im hooked, a must get app!!!!
Great game for any TCG fan. Large shifting meta-game and great forums :) The app is great for your quick fix for this game.
I love this game but I love it because I could buy credits per pack not just set limits. Such as I was tempted to buy 11 packs for £5.99 but know I am not sure I want to pay the alternative. Bring back the old pack buying system!!!
Addictive and great! :D
Very addictive!
I love this game & so do u ;-)
Love playing this on my pc and now it's even better as I can play it at work. Trust me if you like tcg games give this a shot. Hopefully the new update will have fixed things.
"Really great game, any tcg player will love this.

I no there are glitches, but I can put up w/ them"
Good game but shame about all the problems!
Would be a fantastic game if only it worked
Used to be so good, I'd play every day. Now all I got is awful 3G performance and can't manage my deck. Will be 5 stars again when this is fixed !
Should be able to buy card packs for cheaper
it's keep freezing all the time fix  it  then bang u have a grate game to play all day long
This game is sick n really interesting but wot bugs me is d fact that u can't buy clintz directly frm iTunes store which would make it easier rather dan using dat crap paypal.....if dat could be done den dis app would get a 5star rating.
It is very good but it need to be able to get clints much quicker would be 5 star of changed
Everytime I go to fight someone it says I'm already being challenged and if I click on find and evenly matched player it just says my connection to jm1221 has times out, I've tried deleting and re-downloading the and turning my phone on and off, what else can I do?
V addictive!!!
Works perfectly except for the odd crash and its super fun
"I used to play this on my computer and was so excited when it came to te app store!
It crashes quite a bit though and I can't buy players from the Market- only the store. Please fix and I'll make 5stars!"
Addictive but still has a number of glitches, also I'd love to know there definition of a KO.
"This game is very addictive, and simple, what else could we ask for??? <U+E415>
It has it's own unique style to it, which makes this game stand out from the rest and really fun to play. 
This game deserves a five star from me
<U+E335><U+E335><U+E335><U+E335><U+E335>"
Addictive game
Awsum....... But it's solid go get clintz so as the Games currency it's much needed, the other people who have written a review agree with me. If u make an update to be able to get clintz easier this app gets 5 stars
It's a good game but it's really hard to get money to buy characters. Could you make an update making money easier to obtain? The game gets five stars if you do!
After actually learning to play the game it became quite addictive with plenty to do with an interesting new game style
Make time to learn how to play and you will be addicted!
I am losing all the time when my attack is higher but the enemies still win, this is happening more than ever before, please answer why on the actual app or something, it is so annoying and unfair. In my last match I lost to a level 17, both of my cards I played had a higher attack than his but he still won both fights!!! This is cheating!!! Do not get this game until the reason is made CLEAR!!!
When I saw my freinds playing this game I was unimpressed but after I downloaded it I soon became addicted  :) get this app
Ok.. I have Nothing bad to say Apart from when ur about to do battle.. And your foe Withdraws from the Fight! I Think each Time someone withdraws they should Lose say.. 30 Clints or Battle and try and be tactical! But No Running away!! 30 Clints Taken and given to the one standing! If that was done I'd give this a 5*
Great game, really addictive just need to add the prize draw to the app and it'll be perfect, must by definatly
The most addictive game I've played on my iPhone.
Can't get enough of it sssoooooo addictive <U+E335><U+E335><U+E335><U+E335> although to make it 5* get more missions
I love this game. It's great, and the app actually made me start playing on the computer! The only problem with the app is you can't access guilds, the message board, the prize draw or public presets! Add these in and i wont need to even use my computer again <U+E057>
Fantastic app,the only problem is that I've fought 56 times but the mission says I've only done 43 other than that it's brilliant
"An excelent app to run alongside the website! I'd recomend using both, as there is alot that couldn't be fitted into the App, (Guilds, Message boards, comics etc) but I use the app all the time when not at home, and quite often when I just want a quick few rounds! 
Great in-depth play, that is quick to learn, but takes along time to master! Definately worth the time!

The update seems to have fixed all the bugs and now the game is really good. I have been playing for hours :)
Its quite addictive until it crashes- which it does too often. When it does you have to delete and reinstall.
Yes it annoys us all and I'm no exception but there's a simple solution till they fix this. Simply press the home button on your iPod and reload the game and it should start back in your fight, do this quickly and you'll save your much wanted turn. K thx
Can't put this game down, my battery has run out consistently playing this non stop. Great game!
Whenever I click mission the game crashes!!
Love the game. Used to play it on pc. Really fun, would recommend. Nut the bugs and the crashing means that I've had to delete and reinstall this game twice now.
Great game, must have on the iPhone for any gamer
Awesome game, with lots of depth. For easy credit, do missions come in the top 1/3 of tornuments. I advise u to purchase credit at least once, 2 be able 2 trade and buy!
it is really a good thing to do if you are stressed and tired from a tough day at work, I would recommand it for everybody who wanna relax.
Super chouette application !
Need to be able to buy credits on game  using iTunes rather then going on the web and using paypal
currently gettin problems when selling a character it freezes and i cant get back out the character into the clan list well infact i cant touch any buttons complete freeze so i have to press home button delete app and re-download really anoyin me now please fix please i love this game
I started playing this game a few years ago online and I loved it. Being able to play, even when I'm not at my computer, is even better! And people should learn the rules before commenting on how bad this app is. Which it isn't. If you don't like playing in normal, then turn the settings to non-random. Simple!
"Noooo! What have you done <U+E413>, I was absolutely loving this game. 
This new patch makes both my iPhone and iPad freeze when using the Market. Plus I keep getting connection issues and lockups whilst playing.
I give the five stars back when you fix these problems."
Its a great and addictive game, however can you please add that we can play via Bluetooth against friends? That would make it so much better!
I love the iPod / iPhone app! Great and it's actualy faster than my laptop lol. I would recommend anyone who hasn't to check out Urban Rivals online aswell. <U+E405>
All those people who are speaking about how higher attack loses are just playing in the wrong room. Real great game so good
Very addictive
Love the game love trading cards but would like to be able to view cards offline and maybe peer to peer gaming via Bluetooth please thanx
"Brilliant game. 
New update fixed all bugs and added some nice bits too."
I use 2 play this all the time but then went off it because it was the same old! I played it 2day 4 the 1st in a while & now I can remember why I went off it! This game needs updating asap new things new backgrounds perhaps a different style of game mode would b worth looking into! Oh yeah & now I av got the iPhone 4 all I get is CRASJ CRASH CRASH!!!
It's decent but I don't kno how to change my flag.. It shows that I'm American which makes me sick and want to delete the app
Gd game but it crashes everytime you finish a battle
Great game but keeps crashing I can't get back on at the moment it's doing my head in plz update
This game is the best card based MMO but ever since the ios 4 update it always crashes after a fight. Is there an update on the way?
"I now love this game! If you want clintz just play one match in each tournement( fight type 1/2) which occur at odd numbered times of the day. ie.. 09:00 11:00 13:00.
The layout is amazing 5/5
The graphics are amazing 5/5
The music is pretty cool 5/5
Content 5/5
The gameplay 4.5/5
Overall 4.9/5
A great game which can also be played on computer which is very addictive and will get you hooked on this great game.  And its FREE!!!! GET IT!!!!"
If you love trading card games then this is a must great game when you get in to it looks out off this world keep up the good work
It's a really good game, and the fact that it's free makes it even better! Takes a very short time to get used to and is a lot more tactical than first appears! Get it now!
U can trade, and it's not down to luck, two reviews I read before I wrote this, I wish people would take the time to learn the game before slagging it off, this is a quality game, well thought out, well designed, they've got a great website too, that's regulary updated to help u out with tactics or cards to buy.
It started of awsome its a realy good app no questioning it its brim but it starts to shut down every time you try to attack some 1 ;( i would buy it but it will screw up your i pod
Best app going should cost £5.99 but it's free it's a killing get it now
Even if you win by playing higher attack you lose so basically it's a game just of luck no skill absolutely useless wouldn't recommend it.
This is a really good thing the people at  at urban rivals made so know I can play it when I'm not in the house,yay!!!
It says u can trade u cant
Started off good but then once u start playing other players even if ur attack score is higher than theirs u lose the fight!! Useless game!!
it was ok i even ranked 93th in the world but when you get to lv 9 it shoves. you into a room full of guys with cards like 7 - 7 like come on
"This is a good game. 
I thought maybe I had found the game to stop me looking for games. 

Yes it had it all, or so I thought

Rules can easily be broken i.e multi accounts 

If you can be bothered to make multi accounts just transfer all ur best cards to ur lowest lvl account and you can't get beaten. 

Lately I have noticed alot of players doing this and personaly think it spoils the game. The people who have done this can easily be spotted as they have very low levels and yet still have the most expensive cards. 

I had 1 of the game admins contact me and tell me I was reported for multis (I only have 1 account). He then told me he would stop me from getting banned if I gave him all my clints. I told him where to go and that I would contact the developers that was the last I heard from him and was not banned. 

This for me has spoiled the game. 

To many cheats 
Corrupt admins

Looks like the search for a new game is back on"
Awesome
This app is brilliant constantly on it keep it up!!! Also make characters cheaper!!!!
This is a realy good free app.i realy like it 5 stars only problem is that u can have credits in the game but you rarely get them.I've only got 12 and I have been doing it for a month.I wish they were giving them out more also some of the battle icons you can't enter because your deck isn't sutable otherwise this is a realy good game.
Brilliant. Real addictive!!!!!!
And cool, got a panty twitch on
only givin a 5 star review to help the update
"My email won't work when I register it and it is valid 1 aswell I've tried to register about fifty times the bar goes green and then when I click submit nothing happens a new registration form just appears again 
Please help!!!!!!!"
Wats wid da black screen
This game is so much fun. I mo I'm 17 and Im probz to old to be playing this but who cares it a ladd lol get this game
Not here to complain about the game is really good and addictive. It's just that since the last update all I get when I try to load it is a black screen, if anyone knows how to fix this please shout up <3
Went to the website and made an account, it found it easily once I had a web connection and it's sorted now. Great game, good fun, and truly adictive.
I've kinda got the same problem,it's always sayin token awaiting authorization!!!!---it's always failing!!!!-its so annoying <U+E11A>
WTF is going on why can't I access my account on iPhone sort it please
But what is up with the latest update, the screen goes black! Is there a way of degrading back to v1.0
I got the update and now doesn't work?just goes black?
Having downloaded the latest update on the 4th febuary the game screen simply goes black an stops working. Don't let this stop you getting the app however, quite simply so good I would pay for it! Easily the best app available for free!
This is an amazing, addictive game that will test you strategic skills 5*!
Addictive app its free and a good past time also! But loses a star for the update needed for latest version itouch!
But please can you change the way you sell cards. Like maybe make it that you can bid for a card?
The awnser is simple there both as good as each other
This game is sick and its insanely addictive. i cant beleive its FREE! :D
"Obviously this app isn't rated 5 stars (which it should be) because of arrogant people assuming it's rubbish because they can't figure out what to do. Ok maybe it's the apps fault a little for not putting a guide showing you where everyhing is but there is one for the combat.  

This game is so addictive and fun. Best  game and mmo on the app store.
A must get - Its free anyway

Explore the app a bit, read the combat tutorial and you should be having fun in no time!"
"There are over 500 cards available and each one can level up. This changes the picture and adds abilities and makes you want to see what it will look like next. There are booster packs but to buy them you must spend real money on creditz. you can also buy individual cards from other players using ingame currency. the games can go slow as some people dont pay attention on their turn.
Great fun for a free App"
The game itself is great it is has a great look to it and is very addictive but when actually playing the game sometimes it can go a bit slow which kinda spoils things a bit
Ye dis game is good and all but how do. U get credz to buy cards
Very addictive
"hard at first when still getting used to the game but stick it out to level 8 and u will love it :)

too much reliance on spending actual money though as ots hard and slow to earn in game cash"
wow! love this game been playing for over 2 years now :D shame i cant look at the forums or my guild.... or maybe i can but i just havnt found out how just yet :D
its free its great get it AMAZING cant wait to find what this is like (dont get my ipod till christmas day :( lol) but still cant wait
the glitch has gone and now i can play my fav game of all time wherever i want! AND it is free!!!!!!!!! i feel liked ive robbem them :D
I've been playing Urban Rivals on the Web for a few years now and I was really looking forward to being able to play on my iPhone. I must say the team did a fantastic job in adapting the game for the iPhone. The app is really usable as well as sleek. I love it!
this app is insanely adictive    + its free
"***update 2***
reached level 10...the more missions you complete the more clintz you get, just got 50 for one mission, a lot more than the 5 or 10 in earlier levels/missions. What I love about this is that wether your playing against a person a level or two lower or higher than you..heck even 3-4 levels higher than you, you can still win..careful planning and learning your abilities and also mixing it up with gambles on pills makes this a top top game. You really can win even if it looks lost..just think ahead. Sometimes it's like chess the way you have to think. This game has gone up in my estimation. Briliant.

***update***
so I have played this for a bit longer now..half way through level 9...and have decided that this game is very good and well thought out. Yes it takes some getting used to but it's great once you know how. The only issue is how easy it is to get Clintz. I can see why they don't want it to be easy..you have to earn things. And after playing this a while i agree with that. You work with what you have got. But at the same time the devs could throw us a bone every once in a while.

If anyone is struggling I can offer just one piece of advice. Read and understand the different power ups and bonuses for each character and study the opponents cards before playing your hand. Forethought is key here. Even if you don't follow this advice you will still win some as well as lose some but I have learnt that games you might think you would lose have been won by understanding the cards you have. 

Oh and one more piece of advice...once in a while take a risk with the pills..two good first cards and pills can wipe the floor with your opponent. But it is a gamble. But it's more satisfying when you win on a gamble.
*****************************************

I played a game a while back called Mob v Mob and it's very much like this game. The concept in both games is 'the same and both concepts are great. Mob v Mob however had some serious flaws and thankfully Urban Rivals has none of these flaws that I can see. 

There is nothing difficult about the game if you follow the tutorial and tips but what I would say is that the menus don't seem to be laid out as clearly as Mob v Mob. It's also hard to understand how you move the deck About and move cards between decks, which is quite off putting. 

Sort these small issues out and it could well be 5 stars!"
"Before the update I could just browse my cards and see what they were going for on the market. Now browsing my cards I find a ""sell"" button very close to the ""close"" button. Too close in fact as I have many high value cards that I would be furious if I accidentally sold them. 
Now to see the value of your cards you must click on market. No problem. Until you click on it and have to SLOWLY browse three cards at a time to find the one you want to look at. 
Also it seems the ability to look at evolutions of any card is gone. That is going to mess with the market for sure. Ive talked this game up to lots of my friends. I just Hope they got it before this terrible update so they could see how good it was. I've been playing since October 2010. I will be taking a break from UR. Hopefully not indefinite.

Update: same issues as above. They fixed nothing."
"Whatever designer thought it would be a good idea to change the app version to whatever awful mess this is can be solely blamed when this games currency sales see a major dip from app users. 

The new UI is just plain awful. The last app was easy to navigate with big buttons and easy to find options for selling and looking at all your cards. I always enjoyed my experience, heck I even started to like the super repetitive music.

The new app is awful. Small buttons. More menus to navigate all with small text. I understand wanting to update the app because heck your making money off the game and need something to do at work everyday, but you took like 10 steps back. If you showed someone with no knowledge of game both versions, 10 out of 10 would think the older app was actually the new current version with easier to navigate features and an improved UI for easier viewing of yours cards.

Please revert back to the old app. Just scrap this mess and chalk it up to a lessen learned. It's this super old saying, ""If it ain't broke don't fix it."" Or here's another. ""Just because you can do something doesn't mean you should."" 

I enjoyed your game. I will never put another dollar into your company until you completely fix the app because that's the only way I like to play the game. I like to hold my phone vertically also.Usually from the toilet seat at work, my preferred gaming spot.  Now your game might as well be what I'm doing there when I'm playing it at work. 

Stay away from this mess. Any review that likes the new version or says it's an amazing update is fake and generated by some employee of the company. Don't download this game and waste your time if you are still seeing a bunch of people talk about the bad UI."
"Dear Boostr and Urban Rivals crew:

The secret to staying in business is to provide constant, quality service.  This update is utter trash! Makes the game TOTALLY unplayable.   As an avid player for nearly 5 years, I am flabbergasted as to what amount of LSD the developers were on when they released the game in its current format. ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE AND UNPLAYABLE."
I used to play all the time on my iPad, now I get a splash screen and a crash. I'm very disappointed.
Update makes the game awful. Haven't played since. You can't even find who the new characters are or easily purchase. Go back to the old version.
"I really liked the old layout the new one is just way too much.
Hopefully they give us an option to switch to old layout one of this days..... One can only hope"
I was so excited for the update but it just made it a whole lot worse. I understand that they are trying to make it so ppl can get a feel of what it's like on a computer but it didn't work. The game needs a better update. Then I'll start playing again
"Love the game! Been playing since 2010 and have to say that they always looking to improve what they already have and this app is proof of it.

Of course they had a bumpy start but they worked hard to fix the problems that came along with they new app and interface.

They added rewards for those who play on the ipad on a daily basis and have free credit offers not available when you play with your pc. That being said they still have a ways to go to bring us the full features such as guild and events to the app.

Highly recommend you download the app if you enjoy playing the game."
This new layout is horrible. The old one was much more pleasing. I recommend you don't update your game, the new daily rewards isn't worth this...
I really like the chat, solo mode, and the gifts but the collection and market are completely wrong. Please update.
This is a great game. I love the new design and feel of the new menus. Could you PLEASE make the pictures and text larger? The cards and text have become so small it really takes away from the efforts put in to the design. The idea behind the update was great, the text and pictures need to be enlarged.
I love this game but the new layout totally ruins it. It's not even fun anymore as it takes so long to do anything and I have lost my knowledge on how to do anything and can't figure most things out. Please change back to old layout. Or atleast give option in settings. Thanks.
Looks rather nice but is a bit eh. The old version was a lot nicer and at the very least I knew how to log out. I accidentally hit create account on something my phone auto corrected and now I can't even find a way to log out. The cards are abit  confusing I liked it a lot  better when we had the list of clans and all the cards displayed like that. And this is just my opinion but I like holding my phone vertically when I'm not battling.
Why fix something if it isn't broken? There may have been problems with the old UI (none that bothered me personally) but this new update creates hassle where there was none before. Particularly when trying to view the market, the new version is similar to the web interface in that you can search, filter by clan, and sort. However, the screen only shows 3 characters at a time (it would be better to just have a scrolling window). And when you view the characters you can no longer swipe through to see the ending stats/ability, which if I'm looking to buy characters is the whole reason I'm doing the search in the first place. I much preferred the old interface. It was a mistake to update to the new version.
I understand what they are trying to do. Trying to give players the same feeling of how it is on a computer. Sadly however due to that option it only makes things harder. Most pages are filled with lots of things to click but unless you have small fingers or use a tool to touch the screen you constantly touch the wrong thing. The first version was touch screen friendly with big buttons and easy accessibility. I'd rather have the older version if given the choice. However both fail in my eyes in terms of the market. If one sells a lot then it's complicated. I like to see the weekly market value but neither version of mobile has it. So I have to check it on a desktop, but I can't put cards for sale on desktop on my phone so I must then go back to the mobile to put a price up. So much for trying to do very little. I hope they care about everyone's opinion.
I love the new update, but there are just a couple of issues that need to be addressed. First off, I have to go to the market to find the price of a card I already own, which is an inconvenience given I can only scroll three cards at a time. Second, there doesn't seem to be a "friend's list" button. I hope you get to these issues soon
Yo! Implement the activity board and old version collection viewing. This version has potential but bring the aforementioned back to increase interaction with friends.
The new update is absolutely horrible. The whole new app is highly unorganized and was SO much better before they changed everything. After the app updated, within 5 minutes I deleted it due to how horrible it was. I don't recommend updating or getting the app until they change it back to the way it was before this mess.
I can log in from other devices and computer, but this app will not let me log in.
I hate how you can't view the cards levels anymore and the way you have to view them is very inconvenient for idevices all in all it was a very disapointing update I encourage everyone not to update
Love the game, loved old version of the app. New update 10/10/14 just don't like it. Took a step back. Still love the game and will still play a lot. Just disappointed in the changes.
"This new update was absolutely brilliant......kudos Urban Rivals I assure you this new update has been craved upon for nearly 2 years from me...Thank you for the acknowledgment..... The new interface is amazing very user friendly and self explanatory......
Keep up the great work."
"GAME CURRENTLY NOT STARTING UP....BOOOOOOO. hasn't been starting up for weeks now!

if u want a better start, type in Alien Elite in the sponsor box when u register! i'll also give u some pretty good advice on how to beat higher level players with better cards.

PS

INSTA-gay is gay... stop gaying up the review page!.... if u LOSERS need ppl to follow u THAT badly, go pay for a personal website or something and stop being so NEEEEEEDYY on here!

if admin could find a way to stop all these spammers, that'd be great!!!"
Its an awesome game. U really gotta predict ur opponent.. And sometime double predict them! :D
I have been playing this for about 7 years now, well before it was available as an app but the app just makes it that much better. Now I can play anywhere, not just on my computer. I highly recommend this game to anyone and everyone.
Very good game just like on the computer but it needs to show the bonuses. I can't tell if I have courage or reprisal or anything like that and it makes strategizing difficult. Please Pleas Please fix that. Thank you.
Needs solo and ticket slots
Love the game great fun!
For the past two updates my app has been crashing. It a good game but because of this I give it one star since I can no longer play it
I feel this game is good and runs smoothly, could use solo mode though! Nobody can beat me. Im the best
Love this game, so many different strategies you can use, lots of exciting and close battles, my favorite game on the app store!
I keep re-downloading the app onto my iPad to play it but it keeps crashing EVERYTIME I try to open the app. Before the last update for the game it was fine.
Urban Rivals is quite addicting but it needs more of the stuff that is available on the computer version. Adding the chat system, solo mode, or even the tickets slots would let me rate this game 5 stars...
The new update crashes my game every time please fix it
If it had solo mode like on the computer I would give it 5 stars but besides that I love it.
This is one of the best card games for iOS but I wish they would put in the slot machine and ending action with each clan
This game is the best card game i have ever played. But I bought $9.99 in credits and the purchase didnt even come through. So my money was gone and no credits
"I remember playing this on PC in 2009. I went on again yesterday and was shocked to see how much changed. Just glad I can play this game again.

Edit: Join my awesome guild called Lifeline"
It's one of the best games I ever played, but could you please add the slot machine on the main menu instead of having to go on the website
It's crappy now
game
...
This game crashes alot
Doesn't match up to the web game. Graphics stink, no solo mode, and I ended up getting banned for saying this on the website...
It's about time this got optimized for the iPhone 5. Never liked playing Urban Rivals while it wasn't full screen, it was weird. Runs smoothly and everything works.
Been playing this game since 2006 and still keep coming back to it!
If you love anime art style quick strategy RPGs then this game is for you starting out is hard but selling cards will get you any card you want in good time I have had this app for a whole 4 years and it should be way more popular and it's a international game
Good game very addictive
I cant see the top of the screen with the opponents amount of pills/health on the iphone5. It's cut off.
I loved this game, but in a long time they haven’t brought in any critical features or updates and keep doing same stuff again and again. So I switched to Evilibrium – it’s new, more visual and balanced, and they keep rolling out new updates with lots of new features almost every week
It's a bit small.
The game was good and fun but it has one problem.this game only have iPhone version.you should make the ipad version.this is one of your biggest problem.please make the ipad version for the next time.
This game is good but not great it could make it easier and faster to get clintz.
"iPad version is desperately needed. Ignore the reviews that mention Instagram. Not active players, just bots out to scam you. 

Tons of fun here folks! An excellent mix of strategy, leveling, collecting, trading. People all around the world are playing. Never a lull in the action. Thumbs up to the artist, well done! Seriously! 

Also very cool are the tournaments. It's completely possible for a level 15 player to beat a level 80, just depends how crafty you are. You won't be over powered by long time players."
Every time I try to buy inapp purchases next day account is hacked
I'm playing on an iPhone 4S but I can't scroll when any o the txt boxes pop up, it's just kinda annoying... Other than that it's a great game..
Used to play it on the computer and loved it. Just found the mobile and am ecstatic!
Update it so that it fits the ipod touch 5 screen
It's been over a year since the iPhone 5 update the screen size!!!
Love the game I play Yu-Gi-Oh! And this one is very fun but for real o will love to see and up-date for retina-display
Game
I feel like most people don't realize that this app is just a way to play the computer game on the go, if you start by playing on your phone, you're going to miss out on the full interface the full website version has to offer, but the app could do with some tuning.
Kolos is overpowered. Change it
This is the best online card game out there. The app is just another way to play. The main game is online via browser. There are guilds, events, different game modes, etc. you play with and against people across the world. I have been playing this game for about 5 years and love it.
Best game ever seriously
Great game but it needs buona fortuna that's is everything else is simply perfect
3 stars nothing more then that
Amazing
Would be a 5 if not for that
Very good strategic card game. Makes u use your brain to win sometimes. You can get pretty good cards without paying if you are patient. Overall, a great competitive ccg.
Been playing this game for a long time since I got my phone and it keeps getting better I recommend it highly to everyone I meet
I highly suggest making your profile and starting off on a computer though. Use this app as your way to play if your not at home because the computer version has so many more features and it connects to your iphone app also.
Needs to have a feature where you can privately invite your friends so you can challenge them over & over! please make new features....plus The old store needs to come back!!! this new store is too expensive :( please fix this!
"I wish they would update their app. Needs update on description while playing it gets cut off and you cant read the rest. It also needs update on the DT they need to display the time. I keed going to the website for it. 

Overall its a good game. But please update your app!"
This game is pretty fun, I love all the awesome stuff you can do and how the cards evolve and all that.  But, this game is VERY money based. If you want any chance of winning whatsoever, you WILL have to pay.  I don't mind paying a bit once in a while, but if I wanted to keep up with the other people at my level, I'd be spending a considerable amount of money.  Great game, but if your parents aren't supplying you with an unlimited amount of money, then I would not recommend it.
Oh, good game
Don't trust this game or the Tapjoy "free credits" ploy! They are trying to obtain your SSN and steal your identity!
This is a pay to win game. So if you feel like spending real ducats on digital trading cards, then by all means, you will probably do pretty good at this game. Don't get me wrong, the collecting aspect is fun, and the gameplay is mildly entertaining. As long as you're playing players who haven't spent their mommy's cash to buy cards, then there is a good chance you will win. However, good luck playing against a payed player.... Make it easier for a player to earn good cards, other than paying, and this is a 5 star app, otherwise, not worth your time.
Tried Facebook login and the app keeps crashing
It needs more features.
This is a very good game of cards..i love itttt
Good app
I have been playing this all day! trust me get it, its free so why not?
The game is great but whenever I complete a mission and tap to reveal my prize it crashes also when I view missions it crashes please fix
"This game isn't like Rage of Bahamut or Dark Summoner.  It has a very different game play and it gets very in depth.  For a free game, this is amazing.  There is no reason to not get it.
tidus102ff"
I love the game but what in the heavans is with all the instagram reviews??? :P
Pretty awesome
Desperately needs iPad or Universal version.

Get rid of this game. It doesn't even work half of the time I use it. One of the worst games I have ever played. And I am an avid gamer. I am not a sore loser. The glitches are horrible. 0 star rating.

The game is fun but during the match I can't view any character's bio. Please fix!
This game is tons of fun but need to implement some way to get free credits through the app, other wise new players will have a harder time against veteran players who already have monstrous decks but other than that this game is worth giving a try.
Cool !!
"Don't get me wrong this is a fun game... I play on the computer. But the app doesn't work. When I try to log in... It says ""bad URL..."".

And what does Instagram have to do with this app....?!!!!"
its a really good game and concept which is why i paid $30 inside it but for some reason it logged me out n now i cant log back in on the app i can log in fine on the website so i know its not me fix this now!

I love this game, I had a deck that was powerful but also weak. Sinse I've changed my gang to the ones with the T-shirt icon, I have dominated and I'm lvl 27 and I already beat a lvl 138. Get the gang with the T-shirt icon if u play. Btw make sure you get the leader card that takes away one pill from opponent each round.
Love that it's on iOS, though I play on my iPad, this game definitely needs its own iPad version. Hopefully their upcoming title Fantasy Rivals will at least have it's own iPad rendition. 5 stars if this gets full iPad integration.

I have been playing for 3 years and this game is still a ton of fun. Multi-faceted game that engages math skills, strategy, economics and luck. Does not require in app purchases but like all games, they have their benefits. Highly recommend this game.
This game is actually pretty cool. I was skeptical, but I might have to show this to my little sis now. She loves these kinds of games. Give it a shot!
Was promised 1000 followers on my instagram acct if I download & ran yr game.  I did & want to see them I'm @MigraineurofLifR on instagram.  I will change my rating When I See this isn't a scam.  If it is - I will Report you.

"I've played many mmo/rpg's on the app store and in terms of gameplay and UI, celtic heroes is vastly superior to anything else out there.
Sure, It doesn't have the best graphics compared to some other titles, but the overall sleekness of it is unrivalled.
Oh and did i mention it's free?"
This game is beast! I love it! Recommended for everyone!
Amazing MMORG, but it would be better if there was a battlefield where different clans could fight.the only downside is the graphics
Bad Game
This game is the best
I have many hours of fun in this game but hard to get gold as many things can't be bought by the traders.
Sweet game love it can't put it down
Really addictive game good graphics spend many hours on this game deffo recommend this for any one and every one
"So boring
<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0090><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0090><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0090>"
Me and my mates think it would be good if you could tread quest items that you can't tread at the moment
As a long time player i have to say this is by far the best game i have played on my iphone. Ive been playing since the game began and its never stopped getting better with every update. Cant wait for the bew update :)
It's all well and good playing the game but the patching takes up around ten mins for me I recorded it and took a picture but I carnt post it. It sounds a good game, that's if you can play it.
I've been playing since Christmas 2011 and now I can make 15k a day, brilliant game once you get into it, I would definately reccomend it!
Lucky one star, it's unplayable as it crashes within seconds if log in. Don't waste your time and effort. Reinstalled, still crashes @ 30%
Complete quests,earn money,explore lir's reach,kill goblins,wolves,gient guards and to add on to that it's online!
"I have played since July 2011 it is the best game I have ever played, huge map, brilliant animals and mythical creatures, historically correct in every way and brilliant music.

I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH."
I love this game! Very addictive!
Was working fine for a few days but now it won't me log in I'm deleting then adding the app agian ill see if it works other wise would have been 5stars :(
It starts good but I don't like reading and there is no voice. I would recommend it but not if you dislike reading.
I keep getting patching errors after a few days and have to re download and install. Getting very annoying now! (Other than that, game is great!)
Really enjoy playing this game lots to do and lots of quests never a dull moment
"For those with patching problems, deleting the game and reinstalling is the only way to fix it.  Works for me anyway it will get tedious if they keep patching every day.

To the person moaning about the money.....it's an rpg game, it isn't meant to be easy to get the best weapons and equipment.  A level 5 warrior isn't going to be the best, it takes time.  As you level up you can take on stronger enemies who drop higher amounts of gold.  Just enjoy getting there.  There is no great need for gold anyway.

Overall this has improved so much from first release. Love it."
Anyone else having the patching problem-patch could not be downloaded, and your retry and it still doesn't work.
Patching takes freaking 20mins
I played this for 20 minutes yesterday for the first time and it was great! Today when I went on it it said that the patch couldn't be downloaded because its "compressed" or something so I can't play! please fix this.
It's a great idea but it is hard to get money I got to safe up for a week to get 5 thousand gold at it is annoying so any imporove Ment to the money system then game will be perfect
"It love this game and play all the time, but i recently played world of war craft and I have found them to be quite similar. I would highly recommend this game to any one, as world of war craft is pricey. I would suggest more chances to get gold because you can get some pretty good stuff on this game but you need a lot of money, and this is hard to get, unless you platinum. 

Thanks :)
A.big.fan."
Love the game get it now get it now now NOW NOW NOW NOW NOOOOOOW thank u<U+2764>
Well, what can I say other than I love this game! It's fun, addictive and very sociable (I've come across many awesome people playing this game!). Be prepared to spend lots of time levelling though. This isn't a game you play for a bit, complete and then move on to something else. It's a game that you'll probably put more hours into than any other game you've played!
No complaints at all for a free mmorpg
Patched EVERY TINY LTTLE THING JUST STOP PATCHING EEVERY TIME I LOG IN it takes 1 and a half hours to finish patching stop pacthing
U should get this game it is best <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0083>
This is.. By far!... The best app I have ever played!.... I have never deleted it since the day I first downloaded it..... Get it get it get it now!
Can u make this compatible with the kindle fire hd please
Excellent.
Recently i have been told that there is a patching problem because a file is compressed or something, i dont know wether this is something to do with my device or if its the server im on Arawn if that helps. Plz fix
Ok but anoying get rid of the patching and make gold easy to get and make the levelig up easiser
"This is so annoying when I  try and play it says that something is not working 
Fix it or I will really start to complain"
Great game, shame about the cost of gold, but great
"Error, Error, Error! !!!!!!!!!!!!!  Patching problem! !!!!!!!!!!!!!
I want to continue my game. Error, Error, Error!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Not great for such a time consuming game! Error, Error, Error!!!!!!!!!!"
This is better than WOW this is literally the best game ever! But everything is so expensive, You need to lower prices or make gold easier to get.
This ap has just been updated and the update fails straight away, the game isn't too bad, but when the update doesn't work we should wonder how often they test these updates
Celtic heroes was great when it started say can't connect to server because it was patch the game way can't they put an update
"Epic and out of this world but takes ages to load
Thanks!"
EPIC!!!!!!!!!!
Has all the potential to be the best ever. Blows pocket legends and its like out if the water. Great game and free, can't ask for more :) thanks
"This game is amazing 
It is so fun and seems to be endless 
Although this game may not have the best graphics it's most certainly make it up in game play
This is a must play and would be a terrible thing to miss out on
This is one of the best apps I have come across"
This game is good to play but the quests are hard to follow and people that play are very unhelpful but if you go onto Facebook page people on there are helpful
Been playing this game for some time now and had no issues great game however I went on this morning no problem but when I tried to go on it tonight i click continue and it keeps coming up patching issues and something about the size. Please help as I really enjoy playing and would hate to uninstall.
Awesome rpg
Won't let me make my own account
"I've only played for a couple of hours but I really like it already! I was pleasantly surprised at the gameplay and graphics on my iPad having played and enjoyed MMO's such as WoW, FF11 & Starwars Galaxies before on the PC.

I'm Saranna on the Rhiannon server <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0089>"
Awesome it's the new run escape for iPhone
"I wasn't sure about this game at first, takes an age to patch when first loading (Devs, update the app?) and the graphics are good but in a particular style that is reminiscent of a certain kind of desktop game (not always well done in the past)... But it's intuitive, immersive, addictive, difficulty ramps and characters develop quickly, loads of sub quests while main story develops. There are loads of articles and objects (flying carpet anyone?)
You can instantly team up with other players to do a mission or randomly kill monsters... Or dual other players in the castle... There is a lack of gold (can buy it thou) can trade items with other players too so there is an economy, but much like our own & doesn't flow downwards that easily... I have been playing a few weeks and have gotten to level 22 - still much tougher beasts around so will keep building up :-)
It's enjoyable and compelling!"
It can be really laggy at times and the graphics arent up to standard also gold is hard to get, apart from these minor problems an excellent game
It's not one of those pay to play free ones , it's actually really good fun
"Best game ever! Reccomending to everyone. Been playing a year and still not bored. Im lvl 121 already.
 Cool game"
It's an insane game and maybe the best game I've ever played but it would be so much cooler if you could ride horses. So please could you make a horse update and maybe a range of maps on each world. Thank you
Awesome game:) would recommend it too anyone! Would be cool If u could get married!:D
It's been hard finding a MMORPG that was really playable on the iPhone! But this is it! Simple controls and an effective set up <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0084> I'm happy! Yes it's not the most in-depth game but you hardly want to be playing with complex controls on your iPhone! It does take a while to patch first time you load it but that just shows how well it's kept up to date. Not everything that arrives in 3 seconds flat is as good as this <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0089>
why does it need to take so long to load i hate it if i could rate this app 0 i would its so annoying its like your just getting the app to see loading its stupid
This game desperately needs a single player mode just the same as multiplayer but on your own
Best game i ever tried on iPhone ! Awesome !
This IMO is the best game available on the app store, it isent a pay to play either. It's amazing !
Brilliant , baby WOW ;)
By far the best game on here keep the updates coming great game!!!!!!!!!!!
Absolutely superb game don't get me wrong. Walk around, fight enemies, do what you want one of the best games I have played. Only problem is that I can't seem to log in now! Something about a mismatch of some compressed folder or something. Please fix! Then I can carry on playing this superb game
My character is awesome
It's really good you have to try it
"Nice game but its more fun when new update comes.
We want some new things on the game, I'm getting bored when I see same thing and do same thing every day."
When I first installed this I made an account and then I finished making the account then it started to patch and it too long
Best game in the world.
I quit this game cos I got scammed 500k of lux.... Be careful who you trade with
"Most of the prices are way to high im lvl 28 and cant buy better stuff because it's to expensive and real money is needed to continue the game.
Otherwise I love the game and I play it loads"
Amazing
The most amazing best game i have more to tell but its just the best app game
"I found this game amazing and was addicted to it until while on a jotun hunt the game crashed. I was sent to the home screen, and when I tried to continue I found that my character had been deleted! This is not the first time this has happened to me and I will make sure that I will not be purchasing any of the MMO games and advising my friends to do the same.
If anybody at MMO cares about customer satisfaction I recommend they fix this glitch and restore my character ""morzan2""."
Great fun with friends
This game is great i love it , its a bit annoyying at times but after the lags and rest of problems (which arent much) it is an awsome game! 5 star for sure also the support could do with improvement,i have logged on and 500k of items were missing and ive messaged support and nothing
"Best game I've ever played for the iPhone and a worth while download what makes this even better is the fact it's free. 
Although minor fixes need to be done I.e. yellow stones appearing as chickens when trading but still the game deserves full marks"
Good but grafix need improving
CELTIC HEROS IS THE BEST GAME EVER but in the next update they should make bigger maps and FREE expantions
I have played this game since the start and it is amazing and I find it awesome how it has developed!
Great game cost a bit just to get good armour need to buy platinum if you want it but besides that loving the game so far! Best app I have so far defently recommend it for new people try even got my misses playing it ;) top game!!
"AMAZZZIIIINGG!! Im a bit of a noob but its still really good,They should have BIGGER maps,More archtypes,and most of all ,A better combat system but besides that,This is by far the best IOS Game ive played
:DDDDDDDDDDDD"
Love it
Carnt select world plz help also is this game good eneyone
Great game ... Great to be able to drop into a MMO for 5mins or 2hours or just whenever with next to no load time. Update has greatly improved the into quest chain and added a few more throughout. As always, more quests, more areas and just more please!
For a  mmo rpg on mobile platforms it's made amazingly well! Not afraid to take chances with an otherwise de facto genre. Sure there's grinding but the setting and community make it really fun. It's free to play and it's one of the few games that doesn't ram it down your throat about their premium content. Now I'm off back for some more adventuring!
It's really good but it's really hard to get money. I suggest other ways to make money like fishing or something. And also maybe being ale to forge weapons and things. That would improve the game greatly
Crap
Good game but connection need fix I wanna play the game can't get in <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00AD><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00AD><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00AD><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00AD>I missed my group and my friends. <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00AD><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00AD>GOOD GAMR <f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008D>Now I can't remember my name and password I need help please I wanna play game  <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00AD><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00AD><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00AD><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00AD><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00AD>
Love the game but recently not been able to connect to patch server :-/
Nice game but fighting is boring and also note that if u want to have nice equipment and gear u need to play months (no kidding), levelling after 70 level is so slow and like I said fighting gets so boring almost automatic.
I think you should be able to trade every item on Celtic heroes but other than that it is a amazing game.I like it so much that I think it should be 0.69p for the game!I like the new darkfell Picts and stormwings.
This is a good and fun game to play
Great game, but how about riding somthing instead of walking everywhere ?
"Amazing game but mobs need to drop more money

Fix it"
Amazing game to play with my mates, but whenever I try to log in it says there is an error, not just me as my mates also have this problem ,please fix
This game is awesome and it has really good graphics, it is very fun and addictive to play buy the only down Side to it is money, it takes to much effort to earn money. Honestly it takes so long, it would be appriectied by many people if either you made it easier to make money or drop the prices :) many thanks and keep up the good work :)
The best
This game was amazing when I first got it but now it doesn't seem to work I had set the game to remember my password and after the update it didn't remember it! Luckily I had wrote down my password and entered it a grand sum of 200 times then I tried to reset my password but apparently I don't know my own email address because I was supposedly entering it wrong therefore I CANNOT play o. My level 50 warrior and have to make a new account to play. How is that fair please tell me because I don't see why an update should wipe my password and email address from the game servers!
I really like this game I hav it on my iPad and it workes fine but on my iPhone it says it's downloading then when it is finished it dissaperes plz fix
Overall, after the update, the game has become worth playing. Early game can be quite hard sometimes, bur make friends and continue - its worh it
Best free game on iphone, got to team up with other players on some challenges which Im not keen on cause Im not that good & I feel like  letting the side down, but thats just how it is, love it though
Really fun to play and it is free
Very good, great graphics, excellent controls and outstanding community but the slight bad thing is the amount of money you get from mobs but the trading makes it Okay. Levelling system is really good, really good game!!!
"This is awesome! The best there is! Should be first in the top 25! 
Ive been looking for a game like this for ages and I knew it was out there and now I found it! 
Best of all it's free and I would have paid for it!
Get it now! 
Brilliant graphics!
Brilliant storyline!
Customisable character!
Trade and skills!
I would even go as far as to say its a bit like skyrim!"
"This game is so good!
A perfect polished mmo rpg.
It needs more recognition by people!!!!!!!!!!!

This is the best mmo ever for the iphone i love this game
I love this game guys but the only problem is I really want a horse on this game but you cant because the salesman says he has not got any and he would have some in the future and I've been on this a long time and he still doesn't have any so could you do somthing about that thank you and I would be very grateful if you fixed it thank you
The game is very good but when I didn't play it for a few days it just wouldn't work it was just a black screen very annoying!!!!
Great game.New update is ok. However I started my account as a Mage and it worked up until the new update nw it thinks I'm a warrior.i cannot use my Mage things even though I'm a Mage!. Ahhh!
"Great game and I've really enjoyed it but they have patched it and all it says when I try to install the patch is 'patching problem'

Given up with it and deleted it now!"
"What there is is great but there is no way (that ive found) of transferring items between your alts and there is no mailbox system or auction house. I can live with that for now. What I cant live with is how difficult it is for me to log on. Once im on im fine but it always takes repeated attempts over ten minutes to log in which is beyond frustrating. 
If there werent MMORPGs like Pocket Legends and Order & Chaos id be blown away, but next to them this seems unfinished."
The new update makes this game amazing, the GDP are much better and the world is now huge and beautiful. Also the made it easier again like it was before so the gameplay is now perfect again!
Was a great game, updates have made it unrealistic when you get up to levels 70-90. Such a shame you could not have found a middle ground.
Game became worse after the recent update. Pointless playing it now. Way to go idiots
I love this game because of its gameplay and its quests plus my character is a mage with snowman head and snowman wand and i love it!
"This game was fine before update , since the update the game mechanics have gone out of the window. 

They have made enemies far to difficult ,and some classes a bit to weak. How can you be lvl 70+ and struggle to kill lvl 50. It makes no sense.

Enemies aggro far to easy and from much larger distances, it's ridiculous.

It's actually has made me consider quitting this games especially after destroying what used to be a wonderful experience. I actually dread logging in."
I was addicted before the update but it won't let me update it so it don't work any more :(
Good game fun but it to hard to get cash and not enough quests bit like run escape with grinding idea also can u add mailboxes
Really good game but it needs some work like being able to get pets and forging items instead of having to buy them but this update is great
Well done guys the update is brilliant the graphics still need a bit more work though but the new ones is good. I would also like to creat items and use forges and be able to mine resources.  Thanks  for the update bye
Great game really really really really good but ever since the update it don't work
"The fighting setting-out is is really boring and gets dull.whenever I'm doing quest i find it hard to navigate to where I'm suppose to go and there should be a quest pointer or something.

Its also really difficult to make some coin in the game the quest could give out larger amounts of coins, pls fix this."
Won't load qrap
A bad World of Warcraft wannabe, that fails in most aspects ( the good ones anyway ) nothing that really challenges a good player, except for scammers and bad graphics, no achievements, or bonuses for skilled kills and nothing to set it apart from other RPGs, other than that its fun to kill a few mobs now and again!
This is crap I can't even create a character because nothing is connecting or something
I love this game! No criticism but it would be cool if you could build a house for your character
Fcc
Great game! Should have dragons though :)
The controls are terrible and the graphics need patched
Great game but very buggy
i think its a great game, good grafics, its got a lot of fantastic enemys and hard bosses! there are a lot of wepons, helms, bracers, ecc. and good stats to improve leveling. I think its a good game to get (but dont get too adicted) happy playing ;)
Was looking for an alternative to pocketlegends n this game is great but they really need to add pvp n then it will b awsome
Whatever.......while I can appreciate an effort to make a good mmo...this is not it! The UI, rubbish, don't know if it was just me but the game kept on freezing ( ipad2 ) all the time, not very good visuals, I could go on......5 star, don't think so!
It is good but takes time to get use to from graphics and stuff but other than that it is the boss
This game is amazing and it's free!! There is more updates to come involving pvp arenas! How can anyone give this game 1 star <U+E336> <U+E10E><U+E035><U+E10E><U+E035><U+E10E>
This game feels and acts awkward. Graphics and interface are a bit cringe worthy, delete it to make space for order and chaos. There simply is no comparison
This game is very good some of it is hard tho but I guess u got to work your way Up
It really is a great and addictive game and this update is much anticipated... But the lag is currently killing me, omg.
Gutted as I really wanted to play this...
This game is absolutely sick but you should have free platinum when you lvl up! And you should be able to go somewhere at the boat at eastern dock!
"The game itself is very addictive, the graphics are a little chunky compared to other games of its type on the iPad, however the game itself is great fun.

Pros:
The game is easy to pick up as are the controls. Content is great, online community and other players are very helpful. Easy to spend hours playing this game. Unlike other games of this type it is not prohibitively difficult to advance through the game without spending money which is a bonus. Most importantly the game is free. 

Cons:
The classes are a little limited, more spells and skills would be a bonus. Gameplay can become repetitive easily. There are several bugs that made the game crash randomly.

Overall 4/5 as this is one of the most addictive free games I have ever played."
It's a great game but some bugs ruin it example right now when I select a world and press play NOTHING happens it just stays on the world screen big shame because it's a very good app mmo and game wise
Has potential but one I connect after making my character I get disconnected so I didn't get a chance to play, wish I never updated.
Needs more Control over clans like changing what different ranks are allowed to do. But otherwise perfect game.
Brilliant app! One of the best games I have ever played! Apsolutely amazing! Kind of hard to get money but overall brilliant! Free to!
This is an absolutely great app, a little hard to get money but overall a great game, free too!
"This game is like one Of the best things I've played ever u must get it it's soooooooooooooooooo good

Thanks for 1 go the greatest things ever!"
Its a good and addictive game but to get the 5th star the glitches and bugs need to be fixed such as the battles are glitchy... And more.
Great addictive game. Does anyone know if they are working on a new update for this game if so please reply. Ty
Fantastic game but should be easy to get gold
This is the best game ever graphics are amazing gameplay is epic only thing that is quite bad is gold is hard to get but apart from that this game is<f0><U+009F><U+008C><U+009F><f0><U+009F><U+008C><U+009F><f0><U+009F><U+008C><U+009F><f0><U+009F><U+008C><U+009F><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0084>
"This game is amazing!
I cant put it down, it's so good.

I'm a lvl 22 ranger on Gwydion and I started yesterday.
Good weapons, armor, and general items, all free.  But could Have free platinum when you level up?

P.S.   If you join Gwydion and you are a ranger please join my clan it's RangersUnited 

P.P.S my name is Arthurusianus"
The game stopped working for me today. Say's something about and error in downloading a file when I try and log in. Please get it working again because it's a really great game.
"Stunning Graphics,
Big Area,
Easy and Fun to play it is recommended"
"Stuck on a quest I cannot do <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+009E> where's greygorge area? I can't find it. 

Anyway, I love the game. Can't stop playing it <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0083> Highly recommended <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008A>"
In my iPad when I try to connect to the servers it's not working I want to no how I ca. Solve that and when it starts to works I I'll write another review about this game because it just isn't working for me right now :(
Amazing
Awesome game for my iPhone great mmo rpg <f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008D><f0><U+009F><U+008C><U+009F><f0><U+009F><U+008C><U+009F><f0><U+009F><U+008C><U+009F><f0><U+009F><U+008C><U+009F><f0><U+009F><U+008C><U+009F>
I play on world sulis and everyone is great. LourboyFX is my warrior and I'm loving the new places. I hope u will add boats trips from the docks to places. The thing which needs changed the most is gold drops. It needs to be higher for it takes ages to get gold at a low lvl and low lvled people needs the gold the most. Keep up the brill work ur doing. :D
This game is good nice little free mmo ,it's hard too get cash (gold) I bought some platinum coins only 10 thinking I might be able buy some new armour or at least a weapon,but it was not enough  :( you can chat to anyone and join clans and even make groups to take enemies out , graphics 4-10 ,quests 4-10  community 5-10 , uniqueness  4-10 , cost FREE 9-10 ( 9 because to get good at the game you need to buy platinum chips ) 3* for me, if I could i would half a * it.
Best game ever... Don't need to say anything more...
Crashes every once in a blue moon, but all in all is a great game. (Could do with a little expanding, but meh)
It's rubbish used to have it didn't let me go on it so I stopped playing it then I went back on it it crashes on me I mean I don't know if it's my iPad but I can't play on it so don't get it
It was good but now whenever I try to log in it says already logged ib
Order & chaos far better but not bad.
Wicked game great fun and meet new people
I loved the game when I could play but now it will not connect at all to any server please fix this till then it is 1 star
Cannot create acount
Help it says patch server not found so until this is not fixed u only get 1 star!
Love the game but I can no longer connect to a patch server and therefore I can't load any worlds. Please can you sort this quickly. Thanks.
I'm addicted nothing is better star legends and pockets legends are not gone beat this game ! GO CELTIC HEROES!!!!!
Its an extremely addictive game and hard to put down
Brill game very good graphics and just like an online pc mmorpg
I played this title from the second update and loved it, lvling was fun and the social side was fun to, u could lvl pretty quick, even then though room to lvl was very limited u were always drawn to two small rooms and if someone else was there it just wasn't worth the tedious boring grind, after the next update the sane problem lots of people competing for one small crappy patch of land to try lvl up , the update wS very lazy they made the lvling more slow boring and pointless that it used to be and this was the best element of the game, now that's gone there's nothing but a small areas slow lvling pointless waste of time, it's a shame if u want to play a decent mom get order and chaos a hundred times better to play
Crap i got on it crap 5 muinuites wasted i cant even get them back it is a gay game
"Very good!!! Great
 :)"
I registered an account but when I try to sign in it just says 'username in use'. Well duh, it's my account.
This game is too sick, but there is a problem with the patch at the moment and it is starting to annoy me lol..... But on the whole a great game!!!
App would not even start (iPad). Can't rate a not working app. Rubbish
"Best MMO I have played since Ragnarok Online, I absolutely liked this game of countless others I have tries. They just need to add WAR, PVP, and more quests with tougher but more rewarding BOSS protocol monsters.

The graphics are not impressive, but good enough for iPad dynamics, and the playability is great at this stage. The fighting sounds could be better, but the background music is excellent, and varies during battle to a more dramatic theme.

 The only tip for new players is, do all the quests as you level fast to 20 going that way, fettle cap mushrooms are your friends also as its a repeatable quest. Don't hesitate to go to Stonevale even as low level as there's more free exp over there especially if you can party and have a good heal. 

All in all this is a game that in my mind could replace my previous RO addiction, given the mobility of the iPad and the endless possibilities it could bring in the future."
Great game, no problems!!!
Servers are constantly full so you can't even play
Tons of items,quest,locations and holy lord it's FREE
I've only just begun this game today, at level 7 now and enjoying lots so far! Me and my wife both got the game and we enjoy it lots. The graphics aren't "amazing" like some iPhone games but this isn't made by massive corporate game company as far as I know for that kind of budget, but if like me you can enjoy a game for its quality of content rather than the shiny graphics then you'll have fun with this MMO :)
"It's a lovely neat little game so underrated it's fun I haven't had any problems I guess you just need luck definitely give this a go really really good

P.s it's an iPod/iPhone/iPad game the graphics aren't supposed to be stunning ;)"
This game is so good no problems at all!
Best game ever but graphics could be better.
Way too laggy during the evening.
Would like to give a good review but can't even get on to play it - pointless downloading this game until they add more server space
Really want to play this, but all the bloody servers are full, please try to fix this I beg. :]
"This game is amazing, Sure its not great graphics but really who cares!
I did buy some platinum to start me of but then after that I kept doing quests and things and it gets so easy.You literally have to get this! 

P.S If you get it go to Tanaris its the best world and be friends with me! My charecters name is monkeyfish!

I'm sure this game is lovely however I have been unable to play it for some reason; every time I download it it just vanishes from my phone
"I play this almost every day but you really need platinum when you level up needs more races and needs a few more weapons and areas maybe even a new island! 

Love the graphics this is fantastic much better if your a Druid or Mage you shoot out of your staff. Still a fantastic game but it is the second update and the game has improved a lot!

Thank you for this fantastic game! :)"
Level 29 going on to 100 amazing game
"Once the patch today is done the game will stop being laggy.

Thanks for everyones patience."
"Server issue mentioned below now fixed.
Totally hooked. Best get levelling up for next update. ;)"
was level 45 and purchased Alot of platinum when I updated it deleted the account and I'm really fed up been sending emails to support but no reply I WANT MY ACCOUNT BACK
I have tried downloading update when it has finished downloading it just goes back to the old version!
Can't wait for the update
I really like this game and all but I can't wait any longer for this massive update cus it sounds good so if u can, get it out as soon as possible. Well I guess u can't because u have published it and waiting for iTunes to put it on right? That's wat it sed on the website so HURRY UP ITUNES YIDHDHDHHDJEOQUDJDNWLXBDBSHAJFLDHABRHEKSBXBDJWGEN
Best game ever can't wait for update
It's a fun to play with your mates. And the updates sound amazing so the quicker the better
Awesome game and good graphics, it is also easy to get used to and the quests are fun as well. Can't wait for updates as well :D
"Nice game and they've made a real effort. Didn't get lost once whilst getting to grips with the world which is a really nice touch. Its a free 3D MMO  without adverts so I am a little confused as to why another reviewer would think that you wouldn't have to part with some cash at some point?

Nice work guys."
Very good, but i have come to a point where Ive done most quests and it's quite boring, an update soon I hope???
I really like the game but it seems a bit laggy for me
Best free game I tried on app store an hour went past I roughy it was only 30 seconds get this app
Very good game and the graphics are good
I love this game brill for a free rpg only problems are the controls and it always disconnects constantly
"I love this game I thing it's amazing however it is always offline for 5 mins or more which is disturbing  because then I go in another game, do all the updates etc on one day e.g Saturday, also instead of 5+ worlds should make 1 big one however it is to late now,
 Well done, great game, 5/5 !"
Amazing game can't get enough although don't like how you can only have 2 characters without paying for other slots and also the server keeps crashing and throwing everyone off of the game and taking maybe 10 minutes to get back onto the game. Other than that awesome game really fun and enjoyable would be 5 star other than server problems. Fix this and everyone will be happy.
"This is a great app that is really fun for a couple of hours but I think it needs more quests. In particular it needs more that can be completed by weaker players as the difficulty shoots up very quickly.
It also needs trainable skills like the ones in Runescape such as fishing, mining, smelting etc."
"It's graphics fail 
It's combat fail
It's gameplay makes me delete this. Trust me people who say this is the best compare this to Order&Chaos it's really rubbish"
Amazing but does anyone know if you can get in the ravine yet
Needs more weapons for mages at mo but it's a great game addictive and fun some more quests would be good maybe island you can go to off the dock but well worth a try!! <U+E00E><U+E00E>
This game amazing :) it's getting better each update and listens to the gamers I highly recommend this game :) if u need any help My name is roxas and aqua on the sever morrigan :)
u need to tweak skill when u use a skill i does a sort of power up? very strange u could do like a flack on the beast or summin and magic it uses mele why not lightning bolt just make an improvement
Not a bad for a freebie, but expect to pay money in-game. Some parts of the new update have ruined the game slightly. Maybe worth paying a bit more upfront for a better game IMO.
"Very easy to get into and level up,reminds me of the pc mmo Conan.I see it having great potential if they keep developing it.

Must say though having hard time staying connected more than a few seconds in 1.02,rarely had complete disconnects in 1.01."
That is all.
"It's a good game, last time I played i was a tad disappointed but they really changed it up. The visuals are good not to bad and not too in you're face. 

But with this comes the bad point, the servers. I can never get on to the server that my player is on, I know this isn't the apps fault but the creators should invest in more servers to allow more players on to play.

So if you're bored and looking for a free mmorpg get this."
It looks like a fun game to play but the worlds are either full or offline, am I doing something wrong? :( If not, please add more worlds so the newbies like me can have a go at the game! kthnxbai.
My fav app, excellent, 5 star.  I re installed the game for the update and didnt loose my character. Even better now, there r more quests
Good game, but it claims I must update it. When I follow the update link, no update is available. Why is this?
Can't update if there isnt one lol
I like this game it is a good mmorpg but the gameplay is slow, there are too many servers and it needs to be worked on some more
THIS APP IS AMAZING! I WISH THERE WAS ONLY A FEW SERVERS THOUGH COS THE WORLDS SEEM EMPTY. CLOTHES ARE NEEDED AND SPEECH BUBBLES ARE TOO. ID LOCE TO HAVE A BATTLE ARENA AND HOMES OF OUR OWN.
@Abigal have u heard of order and chaos, its alot better of an MMORPG game than this 1 but it costs £3.99
Why isn't this game in top 25 why isn't this game 1# in the top 25 this truly is the best mmo and 100% free! Yes you can buy the odd bits and bobs like health potions but who cares who wants them! and if your wondering I am not paid to say that this is THE BEST GAME EVER all iPod/iPhone user should get it. :-}
It's not the best mmo, but it is the best on iPhone. The world feels really realistic and the way players interact is refreshing. You can form groups and go on quests together and making money in this game has great rewards. Good graphics too! No complaints really.
Very good epic game the only good mmorpg in the iTunes store needs many more ways of making money though otherwise brilliant
All the servers are offline. :( .______.
"Every time I try and make an account, it says it is unable to check account creation or something like that
WHAT SHOULD I DO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
This is a great game :) but there are problems :( you should add pvp, add more ways for money, add more levels, add more magic, add more enemy's and if you have not heard of a game called runescape check it out you MIT pick up some tips ;)
Ok where do I start. Still in beta, things being changed to often which effects u too much. They charge u real cash for too many things that should be free in this type of game, for example hp and mp pots, which means u kill 3 monsters then wait 5 mins for ur mp/ hp to heal. Also for a map shout if you want to sell an item.  and to make a guild/clan it's 2.99. There are only about 6/7 story quests that can be completed in a day or two tops. No real rare items i.e only 1 type of necklace in game. Also money seems pointless as u find better items while hunting. If this was ten times bigger and beta stage done before release then it might be 3 stars. Order and chaos shows u how it should be done.
The servers are always offline. <U+E416>
It's great but more content and better graphics is needed oh and there is like 2 soundtracks
Excellent game, more than I could have hoped for in a mmorpg app. I think I might have got through all the quests though... all that's left is a guard telling me about a landslide blocking my path.
This is free it's 3D don't have to be online and is addicting it also dosent take much space
I like the fact I can play it at work without using wifi. Great app but does need some updates.
Can't be bothered, but good for what is. Makes me wanna get back to WoW D:
It works on my friends iPhone, but not my iPod! But, after playing it on her iPhone I found it very fun and addictive! If anyone has anyway to explain to me why this game doesn't work on my iPod, please write a review explaining? Thanks!
De servers zitten te snel vol vandaar 4 sterren
"Please update this game this you really should consider adding-
•make the combat little quicker.
•make the connection better.
•bigger map.

But overall good game could do with them improvement's, thanks."
Not a great experience after Order&Chaos has set the bar for iOS mmo's. Combat is excruciatingly slow and dull. No actual game sounds other than UI clicks and repetitive music. That said there's potential if the dev continues to build upon what's already there, but as it stands it's not worth the time.
Doesn't work
Best game ever!!!  I never thought theyd put a game like this dorvfree =[]
This game is awesome:D Get it now
"This game is great and very addictive fir rpg fans. 

Gameplay: 8
Graphics: 6
Overall: 7

Update the game so it has more sound affects and graphic updates."
Can't fault this, it's free and seems such a big game. Highly addictive, does kill battery though, went from 76% to 38% battery within an hour and a half (iPhone 4). Would recommend this game!!
Cool mmo for a phone...
Awesome game
What a great rpg....and what a great graphics update
The graphics are much better. Game play is smooth and very responsive game control.
Whenever i try to get platinum i use the nativex (bc trial play is terrible all creditcard stuff) and i download apps play them and i dont get platinum. PLEASE UPDATE! Rately if ever works. Update now.
I love the game it's super fun and I play it everyday but I think the gold u get from things needs to be raise because it takes forever to buy stuff again I love the game and I recommend it.
Stop messing around and update it I asked u when it will be here 6 months ago I said soon smd
Years of game play
I got this after looking at the reviews thinking oh boy this is gonna be cool... What I got? A bunch of bullcrap... Iogged in... And I started to do the whole fighting stuff... But it's broken... I would only do 3 damage every single 7 hits... Not worth getting...
This is one of the best games I had ever played. Its super addicting but still really addicting. Besides the graphics i recommend the game <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+009D>
First off. To all the people complaining about leveling.... Im lvl 152 and that's where it gets very hard. You have to train with a druid unless u wunna burn through 100 restos per Lix. Then it takes me about 5 combos per level. So without Lixs on level takes me about 5 hours. At level 60 one one lix u can easily get 2-3 levels. The game is awesome :)
I can't do plat offers anymore, it glitches out and shut the game completely down and I can't figure out how to fix it.
Please add vip we can buy and get discounts and daily golds please this is a very fun and addicting game
It's too hard to level up! And the amount of gold you earn is too low for each kill. Please fix this. You shouldn't have to level up with Xp elixirs either, they should just make it easier.
It's so fun and really addicting but it's really legit and the story plot gets boring as you progress and in one quest there's like a ton of guards that can see threw my cloaking device thing and it's really hard to beat but I guess besides that it's a good game try to make it to where NO enemy's can see threw your cloaks
"This game is just plain epic! :D You guys did an excellent job in the creation of this game! I have some suggestions (that may get the reviews higher):

1. Add an offline mode so you can play it by yourself or if you don't have Internet at the time.
2. Add the ability to get your own house, for storing gear and regenerating health/energy more efficiently.
3. Add the ability to enter more buildings, such as the Temple or maybe a few residents' houses and add quests for them.

Otherwise, beautiful game! Keep up the excellent work! <f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008D>"
Horrible graphics and gameplay. If you want an actual fun game I would suggest RPG Avabel Online.
Celtic heros is probally the best mmo on the market right now but during the Samhain 2014 update it really jacked up the free platinum offer plz fix !! But other then that I would be 5 stars!!
We should have pets that can fight with us
Love it! Beautiful graphics and soundtrack, but I would like to see more. I think we should be able to make our character's faces from scratch like in the elder scrolls. Personally, I think that there should be one or two more classes, like healers and barbarians. Otherwise, I LOVE IT! One of the BEST mobile mmos!
This game is legit im a lvl57 and there are a ton of places and i mean a lot . Especially the tavern thats awesome. Get this game it will blow your mind like crazy. It surely blooo mine.
this is a really AWSOME game, but I hate how u can only get platinum if u but it! :(
Reminds me of a cheap made fable but look fun so far
I love it the multiplayer is awesome. Some of the quests are really hard but thats what multiplayer is for.
Please please add pets and better loot in chest ive wanted pets for a long time i think it will improve the game alot also i think it would be cool if u added dungeon fights like quest for high lvls to do together and at te end of the dungeon everyone in the group gets gold xp and a item :) tht would b awesome
Bring clouds back for a free supply of deer jerky
"Update:  After the big update, the female character face options still look terrible.

In this game, people who can't even see you, from across the world, can trade spam you. 

You can't turn it off and it's never ending.   
 
No auction system.  

Dated graphics.  Slow combat, bad / old and tired animations.  Poorly thought out quest system.  No ability to delete or drop quests.  Old school kill quests..err...

The mob layout in every zone I visited was atrociously sparse and poorly designed, as if I was playing on an Everquest 1 private server from 2008.  You can map travel..but only if you carry basically nothing.  I.E buy unlocks so that you can travel with more items.  

^ Just not worth the money sync IMO. 

This game has potential, but sadly they have no idea how to develop for a niche market..yet they aren't developing for the core or casual gamer...   

This game has some upsides, but they do not out weigh all of the negatives.  This title needs serious work. 

The player avatars are seriously bad looking.  I think the developer farmed the development out to a group of 14 year-old Korean kids.  The shading is bad.  The art style is fine, but undersold.  The run animations look like an early play station reject design for a bad My little Pony rpg.

The combat animation is TERRIBLE!

I would not recommend this game to my friends or family."
This game is absolute trash whenever I attack it's ether a block,doge or a miss
I downloaded this game 2 years and it was fun get to buy items level up battle fight  bosses this game is really fun but wish we could send our stuff to a new world but you can't you have to start over :( plz update the game where we can send mail to a other world
Well it won't let me log on and it crashes
I had this game two years ago. It was awesome. I had this game a year ago on a better phone. It was still awesome. Had this game at the beginning of the summer. THE BEST MMO RPG IN THE APP STORE! That is why it gets 5 stars!
I absolutely love love love this game it's one off my favorite apps!!! The one and only complaint is that it doesn't have auto correction but not everything about the game can be perfect!!!!!
I absolutely love the game, story line is fun, tons of awesome weapons and armor to use, pretty cool enemies to kill, multiple classes to choose from. However, in the game there is something called luxury items that cost insane amounts of gold, it is almost impossible to get these items without spending actual cash on the game, on average you'll be getting 20 gold per kill, these luxury items can be anywhere from 25,000 to 900,000 gold. Without these items you aren't going to be able to solo high levels on your own. Which brings us to co op , the players on these servers are terrible.. I've lost count on how many times Ive witnessed people get scammed by somebody. Or how many times I've been rejected when asking for help on these servers. I wouldn't recommend this game to anybody because of how it's set up.. No cash, no fun.
Im a big fan of RPGs so this game appealed to me but when i started playing it blew me away it was nothing like i expected! It was soo much cooler then i thought it would be! Get this game it is awesome! Btw if and when u get it…join the clan EliteAlliance!
Downloaded yesterday and haven't been able to connect to a server at all!!! Does it not run on 3G? Is wifi required?
Very very very very great but the need admins to stop scamming

I think this game is awsomw but they should make a new character so u can experience new skills and stats like a character tht can send out a minion to help them and plz add horses it would be awsome to ride on a horse
This is the worst game ever it won't let me play it starts then boots me out and I have to keep rebooting it not worth the time
Im so addicted I love this game to the point I am probably a month behind on homework it is sooo good but maybe a daily 1 platinum would rock my world, this or a daily 100 gold! 5/5 for character choice and and good graphics! DO WORLD RHIANNON!!! I HAVE A 109 on Epona drama like crazy
This game is too good!!! I don't know why people complain about the gold system ,because this game is made so that your value of your character never lowers if you make smart investment choices. For example if you buy heroic ammy for 150k, you can use it all you want then sell it for 160k later making 10k. I started from being worth 15 k to over a million gold in 1 month just by investing smart and avoiding scams . I didn't even have to buy platinum! The leveling system is alright too. This game is made so people get to chose when they want to level. Other games like "Wartune" forces you to level with the "rested xp" and then couple weeks later , you are like level 60 with level 50 equipment. Celtic heroes gives you a choice to level or not. If you choose not to level , then you avoid mobs at or couple levels lower then your level. Overall, this game has gained my respect ,and is a very good game to play for mobile!! :)
This is an amazing game... It would be awesome if they updated the female face models. Right now they're super ugly.
Since it came out when it was new i had alot of fun with it. Each world is unique in its own way. I have played on every server and chose Arwan as the server to play on. It is very fun. I love this game and its addicting! I would love to see ridable horses and add some more unique items that you earn from quests. Not alot of people will read this but if you do come find me. I am a wolf and one day i will make a clan called Wolves united. So join up when u see it! Thank you and see ya later wolves
"1. can you re-add staffs and that kinda stuff and 2.
When people wanna date on it can u like put a dating/wedding area like a park and stuff thanks bye"
Well first off, I've been playing this game 2yrs now and it's getting boring
This game isn't so good. Order and chaos is way better. This game has a stupid leveling system and fighting but it's not many problems. This game also has a pvp arena which needs to be moved becuase you will not be able to do your dailys. This game also has a expensive and not worth it iap store purchases.
"Hi! I am LordyIsBack on the world (server) Danu. By the time of the posting of this review, I am level 81. 
According to many other reviews, it is very hard to get gold, but I'm fine with this because I am not a lazy player.. I always check for bosses that drop 1k gold or so.. That's one way to get high amounts of gold.. And using it I got about 69k in roughly 2 days' playing time!
Another way to get gold is to grind low level mobs.. They might get you low amounts of gold, like 0-40g per kill, but it's worth it!
And guess what? By selling items you don't need, you can get tons of gold in low amounts of time! But be careful.. There might be hackers that hacked their characters to get fake gold, and if you sell items you don't need to them, they will give you fake gold that is not possible to use when buying!!
Well, for the levelling slowness, I also am fine with that because I don't level up often, so I levelled up only 80 times in like 1.5 years!
I also never buy platinum by real money, I use my in-game Gold to get platinum items from other players..
And for the updates that were requested by other players, 
1. Horses.. They are like mounts but they are bigger.. And how about the horse you use is stored at the NPC that says he sells horses for the Maclir NPCs.. Also, how about making it possible to equip your main hand and offhand while riding a horse? In other words, you can add a horse slot in the inventory part that you can change equipped items on! And one more thing.. The horses should be different sizes, the bigger, the more weight they can handle!
2. Pets.. This was requested once in the 75 reviews i read several mins ago. You can add pets for each kind of class.. And add pets from your imagination!!
3. Running speed.. The running of your character is slow, without mounts, but be patient! Of your bag and inventory are full to the rate that you can't fast travel, And you can't afford leystone fragments, Then how about making a second character that can get you able to fast-travel by mailing your items to the second character, and travelling?
4. Well, this 4th request is best not to be made, because the game will be slower, I think.
It is to make it possible to communicate with players in other worlds, and send mail to them etc.
5. Well, this is what I want myself, and it is to make Druids cast energy boost, like the early times in the game. I actually want to level up with a druid that can boost my in-combat energy regen, and I want that druid to be my own druid, L0rdyIsBack or a friend.
6. Last request, also by me. This is a request for a gold gain elixir, that can boost gold gain by a few times, because although I, and some other players, get gold very hardly, this elixir can help absolutely everyone in the game.
Well, whoever read ALL what I typed before this sentence, thank you. And, OTM, please make other's requests come true so the review page doesn't get spammed with requests about improvements to what there is in game?
For the stars, I would give Celtic Heroes infinite stars if possible! :) Good luck, players and OTM,and have fun!
P.S. For OTM: Can you make more games please? Like.. More MMORPGs, or other addicting games! I have an idea for a game, and that is ""Celtic Heroes Run""!
One more thing... I can't believe I typed a total of 3323 characters!"
This is a great game i don't know why people complain about the clans, and how you can't progress a clan because there are too many already out there. well i started a clan a few months ago now its the 16th, most powerful 5th, largest, and 2nd most active clan on my world it isn't hard. earning gold isn't really that hard if you know where...i can earn 1,000 gold in less than 30 minutes at level 50, which i can do WITHOUT luxury or elixirs. great game best one i have. Mounts are fine where they are, they are expensive but when you get one you will know you earned it. It is kind of hard to level but i like it being hard when i kill someone in PVP(player versus player)i know i earned that kill.
More updates more classes and more places and money :) !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I played this game until i had a lvl 36 mage, i quit because i couldnt do the quests alone and required people to come in and clear all mobs so i can barely kill the quest mobs.  The money pick up is a joke, health regen is worse and dont get me started on mob speed vs your own.  Its like usain bolt on cocaine.  I downloaded order and chaos online, back when it was 7$ and it was sooo worth the money, and they have mounts, does this game have mounts? NO!  If i had the power to take this game off the app store, i would. It is a waste of time and space.
"You should add enchanted woods with trolls and fares and living trees and other magical creatures and it 
Should be for lvl 30 there's never eny thing for lvl 30."
Im mad i never got my platnum please fix
Overall...great game, but it could use some serious work. Graphics, story, stuff like that. Make it easier to earn money, make it easier to earn items so that the players are happy, update the item styles, make it look better, it hasnt changed in what? 2 years? The players would be very happy with an update to make things look better, update armour, weapons, everything and make it better, including graphics, ravensword graphics, ravensword has good graphics, but seriously it could use a lot of updating and work.
This game is so addicting I can't put my iPad down. This is by far the best apple game I have ever played. I can't wait for there to be a new update. If u don't have this game I recommend that u get it right now.
My world herne never loads and i  have my best class im a archer and lvl43 it takes about one day to connect plz make faster tooooooo loaaaaaaad
Would be the number 1 app in the iTunes Store if the invested into better graphics , games like The Dark Knight Rises and Grand Theft Auto is ahead with extremely detailed graphics
This is a great game! I see people complaining about the level system, but the fact is they just don't know how to level. I'm a level 103 and I'm lvl at least once a day easy. If you like MMORPG's I highly recommend this game.
Pvp glitch when a person is far away u and your in a pvp battle 1v1 and they die far away from u becuase they run and u dont get any pvp plz fix people always run
So, many people are saying this is the best MMORPG in the appstore. NEWSFLASH! It isn't. The best MMORPG i've seen is Avabel Online. That game has better graphics, NO storyline or random quests, and is easy to level. In one day, four of my friends got to level 30. You don't have to run all around the world to get to a destination either. You can actually jump, and you get a skill to "dodge"  but everyone uses it as a running skill. So delete this CRAP and get Avabel Online!
"So i was thinking would it be cool if they added pets most people said totaly some said no but i think its a great idea so if your reading this pls add them.examples: boa constrictor baby fire dragon war horse nightmare (where you get the mane of nightmare )
Also pls make it so your able to upgrade/ grow them level them up also make it so when there big enough u can ride them so please please add them ."
Great game, played it in the past.  D/l'ed it again because it's awesome and unique.  Problem: lots of connection problems at start up log in.  Hopefully this gets better and I'll 5 star this puppy!  I'm on iOS latest updates.
It's actually a pretty good game. Graphics are not bad and combat is very intense. Here are some cons I noticed...for one, everything is WAY too expensive. I mean if you want to be pretty good you HAVE to buy gold because every guy you kill only gives you like 10 gold, whereas all the armor and weapons cost like 100,000. Secondly, it can get very tedious after awhile. After you beat the story, you have to level for awhile before you can go on and complete the next. You could spend hours or even days and only level up three or four times. Finally, BEWARE, there are a lot of scammers here. They will try to rip you off! They will try anything to get your stuff. But there is a new update coming up that will be epic!! So, in other words, yes, I highly recommend this game.
Like the title says and not just big HUGE its 0% to 465% ples make it a smaller file
This is an amazing game that I recommend getting. It's so expansive and complex. I could spend a whole day playing it and not even be close to doing everything it has to offer. It's a potable mix of Skyrim and world of Warcraft. There are tons of places to explore with such a big map and all these underground areas. And there are so many different enemies to fight and friendlies to talk to. It's social and complex with the inventory system. There are so many different weapons and items and potions to experiment with. And the endless amount of extremely fun quests that require strategy and planning add hours of fun gameplay. I definitely  recommend getting this game. You will not regret.
"hello
i buy sack of platinum
but i dont have anything this my nikname: Msmagic"
it wont let me sign in this is crap im so mad may name in the game is breck213
Y cant people just give me stuff there being a little greaty so if u could get me stuff it would help alot thz:)
Beast game ever
Everytime I go on it won't let me log in. I restarted my phone and everything. The only way I can get in is by creating a new account. Then backing out to main menu and signing in with my original. And sometimes I have to do it multiple times b4 it works. I really love this game but it takes 5-15 just to get in the game. PLEASE PLEASE FIX THIS PROBLEM. I am begging you the developers. I really like this game.
As soon as I logged in and started playing I was hooked it became my favorite game instantly.  Definitely recommend it to anyone looking for a good RPG MMO.  But it's not good it's amazing!!!
There is a problem with this game. So, to play this game and be good at it and be high leveled etc. you need to invest a lot of time into the game because you move so slow even without a hat or gloves you are still slow.
Plz fix the bugs I can log in cuz its say connection online use different wifi n I'm not the only one having this problem my friends too i ask them
This game is great but something happened and i can't log back in this is a great game so plz fix it asap
A lot of other mmo'so could pick up some key points from this game,that said there is still plenty of room for improvements such as npc voices and monster sounds , also area soundtracks need some tweaking.If the game sees updates more often it could become a big hit !
Horrible in many ways. First, there is no way to earn money in this game. Second, the fighting system is horrible I would rather go to gameloft and spend 7 bucks on a game. Third, you have to fight npc's that are higher levels than u and because u can't make money there is no way to win unless u become lvl 300 just to fight a lvl 50 because u can't buy armor without begging to the people who simply buy their coins with credit cards. Fourth, all of a sudden enemies are all Olympic runners and outrun u like its nothing new in their boring lives. 5th, u probably have to make 3 new accounts just because u don't bring ur vitality or strength up perfectly in a pattern to buy armor. And finally other players that are high levels and sit in the castle just to show off are a holes
I really love this game. I just wish there was horses and a voice for the AI, other than that the game is totally perfect, recommending to everyone. If you want to play with me I am Programmer on Rosemerrta
I would give this a 5 star but their are a few thing that they fix. Please game creators put in a side mission quest guide when I do Side quest I don't know where to go it always lead me to the main quest which I can't do because the enemy is like 10 lvl above me so it hard for me to get experience please add this
I've done atleast 3 game downloads to get platinum and I haven't gotten a single one... I'm due at least 200 platinum but nonetheless it's a great game
"I love the game so much , but the problem is that
I always get tired when I walk far distances and I either have to run or put my stuff in my chest to fast-travel , and I thought of it so I decided I'll write u a review to add rideable horses! I think the game might be better and after that everyone will love it more.

Kind regards
Fahad

P.S My name in Celtic heroes is fam2005 and plz ban whiteberrys he's a scammer he scammed in a dice 1k"
Download it and atleast try it out!!
This is a fantastic game great community and shoutout to everyone on Gwydion! But the only downside is tons of scammers trying to steal your items so tip, dont give out your items to anyone! Good Luck!!'
"Celtic heroes in my opinion is the best game on the whole App Store it is very fun and you can customize and choose from differnt characters when I'm not playing wow this is my favorite game to play. Anyone who likes my review should definatly download this app it is amazingly fun I hope you all enjoy it. 
Sincerely ,
Steven Butner fan of Celtic  Heroes."
You need to be able to make money in the game without having to use real money to buy plat
Awsome!!!!!!
Yes I have been scammed out of my account I want it back very badly I'm lvl41 druid named kyneras my account is not my own anymore and I need help of u the creators of this game can find it in ur hearts to block the account and reaturn it to me I will give it 5 stars plz i want him back more than anything plz help me!!<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0094>
Fun game but it has a few issues.  Whenever I try to log back in to my account to play,  it says that it can't connect to the server.  So I restart my phone and do what it says and the problem still exists.  I created a new account and it magically worked again for a short time edited crashing.  The game is awesome when it works.  I just wish it would stop doing these things so I don't spend ten minutes trying to create another account and only five minutes playing.
This game is great... But the arena should be a 1v1 place where all the severs join a queue to go face to face 1v1 with a random person, once ur a high lvl it starts to get boring so then in result u go to the arena, just have the 1v1 connected to like game-center or something, this would make the game 100% better, it doesn't seem right that is an open area... Make it like Darksoles or something... Please take this into consideration... Thank u :)
Hey one thumb you please please make more races like world of warcraft join with blizzard and you can make the best game ever make more races and more quest like WoW join blizzard and you can conquer the App Store please one thumb on your new update consider to
I downloaded it but it won't show up any advice
This game blows no way to teleport to friends not recommended not the best game poket legends is recommended from me
This is the not the best mmo I have ever played but it's fun to play when not at home or when bored.
This is the best game ever but I think you should start has a level between 20 and 90 area
When i got the game half way through the install and it stopped i installed it again and it says this game is already purchased idk why i cant play it plz help
The game is fun to play but you need to make it easier to collect gold
The game is good and everyone should play it but there is this thing called dicing and i lost all my money 62k from a warrior from lugh name WAZZZZZZZZZUPPPP it is really annoying can i plz have my coins back my name is ICEWARRIOR
This is a awesome game! I think anyone who likes 3D MMO should get this game uploaded! I have a couple of suggestions, for the newest update could you guys make a diffrint type of Dragon Lord. A glowing maybe? Thanks!
Please fix the fact that it takes so long to put points into your skills. Like add a bar like the stats bar instead of making us press "upgrade" then "ok" 184 times
This is the worst game ever. If I could give 0 stars for this game I would. WARNING THIS IS A TERRIBLE GAME. DONT PLAY EVER. They don't care about their players. If someone gets scammed they don't give back what they lost. Even when they got hacked by other people. Don't play. You'll be disappointed.
Ive been playing this game sense before the big update and i got to say i love it then but i love it even more now!!! Especially with the knew creatures they added and the weapons are fantastic!!!
This is a really good game no doubt about it but getting gold and leveling are literally the hardest things to do you will have to grind tons tons to get at least 1000 gold to buy decent armor that is expensive as hell and the leveling is annoying have to not do any quest for a set amount of time so you could go level to at least have a fighting chance. So i say to the reader of this review 1). Thank you for reading this far 2). Downloading this game is entirely your chose
The only problem is that it is really hard to make any money. Other than that it is perfect.
This game is really fun and all, but today I lost my lint cane and I do not know what happened, like I had it before I exited the game, when it got back in it disappear, please help
I love this game and if you dont you probably never took the time to get good i just hit 120 and am a proud gaurd of nitro... But hands down 5*
Gold drop is to small unless u made things cost less cause u can't get gold unless ur high lvl for noses thx for reading
What the crap, I am stuck on lv 37 I would have been a 50 by now but no, my lv will go to and when I should go up it just goes back down the zero xp. Fix it please
I've only had this for 3 days and I am hooked! It works great on my 3GS, definitely recommended!
"Owner can u make pob2002 have 100k or i rate this game 0 its so bored BORED
BOREDBORED"
I putted 3 stars because the game is good but not quite good... I'm lvl 102 and the problem is that with quests that you need to kill way higher  then yours.. For doing that it usually you need to ask for help of high lvls but not always they could help and sometimes you need a huge group of people to take down one thing... Everything else is perfect, how they add new skills, new places.. But the lvling system is hard... If you kill your own lvl guys they won't give much xp and it takes tons of time to lvl when your high lvl, to lvl "quick" which also takes some time you need xp lixs that cost gold/plat. Plus with gold.. That's also a kind of a problem because paymasters are very rare and they don't give as much too.. Plus the mobs the higher lvl they only add few more gold and at lvl 100 the max i have seen is 32 and plus it's a 4 star which is takes some time to kill too.. the bosses give more gold as usual that's also a good thing. Everything else is just perfect. I would like to expect more.
This is the best mmorpg game I've seen in the App Store. But by the time you reach around level 60, leveling up can become a hassle. Most of the quests I have to do require me to be much higher level to be able to beat the enemies. I think that as you go up in level that the experience dropped should increase. As well as the gold! The price of the armor and weapons from the merchants is outrageous! It may take 1-2 weeks to get the whole set of ancient armor and weapons. And by that time you're probably in StoneVale, where you'll discover better armor from a different merchant so it's like you put all that precious time into tedious farming for NOTHING! But other than that this is a very interactive and addicting game.
If you like Runescape then I suggest this game on your mobile, it's awesome!!
It's super awsome i like it :)
This game is just awesome except could someone tell me how u can get body paint
Thanks to your new update my lvl189 character just disappeared. The game said disconnected then I'm like ok I'll come back in about 5min and now my high lvl character is gone and I have to start from scratch. Thanks a lot cause all my money spent is gone.
Starting screen so messed up, waste of my time.
I've played this game before and have had fun with it. I downloaded it again yesterday and it doesn't work. I can't sign in or make a new account. It just loads forever or says I can't connect to patch server.
Enjoyable enough, but to get ANYWHERE as a player you need to spend real money. Funny thing is, if you ask the players that have spent thousands (yes, thousands) what they would pay if there were no in-app purchases (i.e all items/upgrades earned, not bought) they admit they wouldn't even pay $20 . Bad graphics, bad drops. Too many scammers.
Can you guys add a night theme in it? it's always day time unless you go into some sort of cave.
This game is quite fun and very well made. Any mmorpg lover will enjoy this. I do have one issue with it though. There is no way to delete quests you have taken. I hope the makers can make that happen but other than that it has no flaw.
Very well put together, best mmo on app story so far. Great community, great game and still getting better.
I love this game, but it has so many problems. The most prominent, is the graphics. The pictures make it look wonderful, but the people do not look like people. The most annoying however, is how infrequently I am actually able to play the game. 80% of the time I try to log on, it tells me I cannot connect to the patch server. I restart it and change the wifi like it tells me to, and it still doesn't work. Frustrating!!!
"While Celtic Heroes might tick all the necessary MMO boxes, it does so with so little flair or enthusiasm that its unlikely anyone will have the energy to reach later levels. Combat is so dull and uninspired that, even at later levels where the more interesting abilities begin to appear, it's more like hard work than anything even slightly enjoyable.

Beyond all this there's nothing inherently wrong with Celtic Heroes and if you're looking for a new grind then this is as good as any, but you'll soon tire of its barren landscapes, repetitive quests and poor combat. MMOs require dedication to properly appreciate, but this lacklustre example of the genre isn't worth the time."
This game is great and fun! If you like MMORPG this is for you! And to all you haters out there, it ain't that hard. I'm at lvl 77 because I took the pain of lvling and got there. You just have to keep lvling in between quests to be able to do them. Now quit your ugly complaining you lazy noobs
"Well this game is great and all but it would be awesome if you guys added a few stuff like.. 
1. houses for everyone.
2. Pets.
3. An emote animation : sitting down.
4. Creating own homes. 
5. Cutting down trees.
6. Staring fire pits.
7. More abilities to lvl up.
8. Real farming. 
Yup. I know this is a lot of stuff to ask for but it'll make this game for entertaining and funner. Sooo yeahh."
I love this game but sum of the quest are to hard like in the lvl's and for the next up date I wish they would have every power for that class even if u Cnt get it yet. Hope this happens
I have lost like $200 or more playing this game now I can even get my progress back some how you can't find my email Game Center is no help how do I get my money back
I had a stormskimmer 80% speed it cost a lot i tried to mail it to my other character it said exact level exact name and when I mailed it it dissaperred ,,,,, can I please have it back i checked inventory mail and on all characters they were in same world
After spending over $200, you still cannot excel. Spending money is the worst part to this game.
This game was fun at first but then I realized there are so many higher levels that I will never catch simply because of ksing and boss hoarding, therefore it gets boring, there needs to be a world for a fresh start please
The game is awesome and everything is good with the update.
I think this game is awesome because it is challenging,but the only thing I don't like it is because it is not modern.i have been thinking about you make a modern day games with assassins, gunners.i don't know what else you can put in,that's your work.pls make it
hi can all play on lugh please
So I've been trying to get online for the past 2 days. I uninstalled. Downloaded again. Still didn't work. I turned my phone off and on. Didn't work. I checked to see if I typed my password and username right. It did, but it still told me "error" or to turn my phone off and on. I was really having fun. :/
I like this game. But you need to make a few things different. Like all kinds of classes (mages, warriors, stuff like that) they need to be equal. When they are I will give you give stars.
Played this game since its release, i have to say its gone downhill. Lower levels stand no chance to progress because higher levels kill every boss they can. This makes it impossable to get the good accessories and the items needed to complete quests. Smaller clans have no hope because large super clans now dominate every server which means you HAVE to join the super clan to progress. Health and energy regeneration rate is a cruel joke, item pricing is ridiculous, amount of exp needed and given at levels over 60 is straight out of oliver twist ("please sir, can i have some more?"), movement speed without high priced items is stuck on snail speed, attack speed is no better, and the designers of the game no longer listen or care about the feedback any but their pet players give. Other than that its the best (simplest) laid out classic mmorpg there is on the app store.
"This is my lease favorite games animation is bad inappropriate lang and little inappropriate body use on animation scamming is two much i lost somthing cool and i had to wait a year till the items arrived and etc.
Goodbye i will never come back..."
This game is awesome for all those complaining about gold and quests...go farm it's easy just time consuming ..and your playing the game to waste time anyways....lol..it reminds me of the first Everquest mmo when it first started , the only thing missing is the DING when u level up..maybe they will put it in with the new patch(suggestion).
Slow updates 12+ months for a update , and always new armor that is all . Event are the same freemiun items and collecting so if you want fun and competition look. Somewhere else
This game is awesome butt when I log in I can only play for 10 seconds and then it says connection error and I keep trying but it still says ERROR PLEASE fix that I beg you.
"I think the game is great, but after a while it gets boring. Mainly because the quest get too hard after you complete the main story. But here are things that would make the game better. 
1)make items easier to get
2)make leveling up easier
3)player interactions (such as actions with another gamer such as slap, hug, kiss,ect 

Ps don't choose mage class"
This game seemed awesome at first. Then the more I played the more I realized how little spells you get as a mage. It seems they could have worked better on their classes and the skills. And this game has been out since 2012 and so far I don't know if they've had updates but no update since I've been playing. That's what I give it three stars and I no longer play maybe if they add some skills new areas I may give it another go...
My Favorite Game to play! Best game! Download Now!
"Hi everyone i think this game is cool but 
BEWARE of the scammers. Celtic Heroes must get rid of them and we shud get our stuff back! Is support really a support? The answer is NO.

I love this game it is a fun MMO to play,when will we get an update please tell us we are all waiting.Can't wait
Support refuses to solve game issues. Refuses to reply to mail. Dont bother installing this app.and i wish i could give zero stars but that is not allowed.
"It would be a great idea to make it compatible with the zeemote wireless controller!
I think a lot of people would like that<f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008D>"
His name is LilOgKush.World Mabon.And is level 105.I feel that I want him back because I worked hard on him and I promise to never do anything bad on him.
This game is fantastic but there is some prob in it the gold in mobs too low but it still nice game and if this prob solved this game will be double fantastic :)
Awesome game its so fun PVP is the best from gumballzisbak
I'm a super black Zulu negro
First problem is the leveling system. You can't just go through the main quests all in a row, you have to do all sorts of crap to get through them. I'm level 24, and I'm facing thirty fives. That is a horrible fail for levels, because you usually can't beat an enemy out leveling    you by two levels. That's nine extra levels. Two, there's a horrible combat system. You can't dodge except in the technical sense, because once they're locked on, they can't miss, really. Three, when in combat with hostile NPCs, they somehow run at like 50 miles per hour to catch up to you when you try to run, so you're not safe until you are out of their targeting zone. Next, when you run away from an hostile NPC to regenerate your health, their damage resets so it's like you never fought them! What did you say? That's four problems and I said there would be three? I don't do good with math. :)
"Plz add horse and make it so that they are the same prices as the staffs and do the same thing 
Plz make it so that mobs drop more gold
Amazing game though"
A great game just needs to be fixed to where the blind and visually impaired can play
For some reason it will not let me connect to my world (herne)
Logged in, picked up the first quest, killed a mob, logged back out, uninstalled. If it's gonna end up being pay to win or pay to level up like so many people are reporting, this game isn't even worth considering. Nope, nope, nope.
"Just change the battle play to something like final fantasy. The fighting is to boring.

Needs to change."
Outstanding! The best RPG you could play. Along with good updates and items  I cannot stop playing this game it is a must get.
I speak for every single level 60 in the game when i say this and unlike all your other reviews this one needs to be do e or your to lose "alot" of players. Make the 5 levels per armor peice at level 60 all available at 60 because no one who is level 60 can get to level without being forced to buy Elixirs and therefore is going to ruin your game so i highly recommended you change it back.
PowerFish1 Hacking is not cool! We have tried over and over to try and receive accounts over the year and nothing, but we will try hard!
Any axe around here?
The people who hate this game are on crack! This game has everything-awesome storyline and hardcore gaming.
"Let Me Start Off Of How Bad The Faces 
Look. HORRRIIIIIBBBIIIIIIIILLLLLLLLLEEEEEEEE. And Put More Suits And Hair. And I 
Will Keep The Game On One 
Condition: Do What I Please, and Then People Will Start Buying The Game. 
The Consequense if failure to Comply:
I WILL TELL EVERY ONE OF MY FRIENDS NOT TO GET THE GAME Along With me Also DELETING THE 
GAME. Make It Work."
"I love this game!!!!

It is literly awesome!!!!!"
IT'S SO AWESOME IM lv 66
I love the game very much. It is awesome. But there is something wrong with the combat. If you are fighting enemy's and you are almost dead, and you try to get away, the enemy are like 3000 times faster than you if you try to run away. This makes combat extremely hard. Please fix it.
My account was hacked i want it back my guy was called Herogooper
I've played this game since 2011 Halloween and still have horrible items! I asked support for help and they didn't even respond!!! The only way they respond to you is if you have the word hack in your message. I've waited like idk maybe 3-5 months for an update!! My friend told me why this happened. OTM is just a bunch of lazy, greedy people sitting in an office playing paper football! You basically need platinum 24/7!!
This game is extremely fun, but could use some better graphics. It has a vast amount of places to go and items to improve your power, I highly recommend this game if you like MMORPS's!
Awesome game but just could you make it able to to send mail and items to other worlds that would help out a lot so that way we can interact with the rest of the servers but on the others and great game and there should be animal mounts that would be awesome
Some dip wad hacked me and I lost everything I had! 20,000 gold, my Ancient Bow, all my Bodkin arrows, and all my armour!
This app is fast and uses little ram and wifi internet, i recomend this must downloed app, love celtic heroes.
This game surpasses even the best computer MMORPG games.  I love this game.  I could play for hours and hours at a time.  I’ve spent more than $800 on the game.  Crazy, I know.  Anyway, this game is beautiful and I can’t wait until the new engine update comes out!
The game is awesome but how about adding some more adventure and action and add more places
You guys need to update this game and add some new stuff.
I spended 25$ on this game and my account didn't work after I logged plz fix although great game love
It's really a fantastic game!! Probably one of the best on iOS. It's challenging,fun,and highly social. The only problem that I've noticed is that there needs to be an easier way to get a lot of gold you get like 2 gold for every typical foe...when everything in the store costs thousands!! Like I said great game,loads of fun but money needs to be easier to come by. Please update!!
This is my favorite mmo please fix the sound,you cant even hear the footsteps..please fix and i will give it 5stars
How come my game won't let me sign in it will load then kick me out ? Please help
Some times when I log back in the game, it restarted my character. Pleas make it so we can get married. And also so we can have our own cottages or castles, pleas cause that would open the game up more. And make it easier to get mounts and good. Thanks :)
:)
It looks like a fun game but it says there is not enough room to download. The thing is I have 653 MB available and in the description it says I only need about 350 MB!!!!  PLEASE FIX this issue!!!!
"Pros: 
3D graphics
Descent music
Good quality of graphics
Many item shops for each rank of levels with a good price for the items
Good enemy models
Terrain is awesome
Cons:
You have to grind enemies quite a lot to level up and gain gold
The player model and hair styles are outdated and can be and will be remade
Side quests are hard to track
Gold is hard to attain from enemies however they are easily earned in quests"
This game is very enjoyable. But for the next update i think there should be something added into the arena like competition. But also heres a big game changer somehow there should be a world war like different servers against each other. Also i always wondered why theres a boat sitting at heroes landing, there should be an underwater zone there. Just an idea to keep in mind. But everything's in this game is pretty awesome.
I love the graphics and details in this game, and I know you worked hard. But for some reason, I keep getting disconnected from the server every 2nd time I log in. Please fix this bug. Until then, I say this app is three stars
There is no other game like this!  This is the best MMO I have ever played in my life! I introduced this to my siblings and they love it!
Lately i have been having problems connecting to the patch server...Plz try to fix but game is great over all keep up the great work
The leveling process is... Very confusing I'm like a lvl 5 then get up a few more to lvl 7 and it's like a lvl 9 zone then I get to lvl 9 then it goes to lvl 12 zone then I get to lvl 12 and it's like a lvl 17 zone. Then the quests don't actually show you any other quests except for the main one unless you keep on going back into your stats and inventor and go to map and read the quest log. Which is why I think some people may over lvl to quickly because they don't even know that there's secondary quests till its to late to give them any xp. So could you please add secondary quest pointers or boost the experience or something so that I actually am at the lvl of the zone and don't have 30 quests in my inventory. But besides that the game is great I love the graphics and the dueling and money pay is fine and everything I can't complain there
It is a great game no matter what. Just in the next update reduce the price and sell cost of EVERYTHING
"Game has good fighting, great group battles n solo, many quest, many weapons n armors, little bit of need to spend real cash for special items, and five different classes
Amazed all way"
DONT PLAY YOU CANT SLEEP AND CANT DO GOOD AT SCHOOL OR WORK DONT GET YOU WILL END UP SPENDING HUNDRED OF DOLLER'S
this game is fun addictive and socially active you should down load
I cant say it enough. The game is something special... However i have never experienced sucha horrible community then on this fame
If yall ever need help in taranis look for dragon19 lvl88 mage very strong and powerful but only help lvl70 and up
I personally would give this game 5 stars if you made mobs give more exp depending on your level. It makes it too hard too hard to lvl up. You should also make rare mobs that drop plat.
"I love it.  Great people, great game.  To all those who say you need to pay to win, that's only if you're lazy.  Farming for gold gets easier the more you level so that's not a problem. Only things id ask for is new skills and pets. A pet that class gets to help them would be awesome. Maybe like 
Rogue- Wolf
Warrior- Bear
Ranger- Falcon
Not sure about druid or mage. Just food for thought.
All in all. Great game."
"My profile was stolen and I spent over 100$ on that profile 
I stopped playing because of this it needs to be fixed"
You guys should have pets for rangers think about it in the next update
"Hey everyone! If you are looking for an awesome MMORPG to play, this is the game for you. I highly suggest this game for it's high graphics, speedy updates, and great storyline. Even after you've completed the game and have reached maximum power, you still aren't done! The great amount of fast new updates allow more fun as they add new items and opportunities! Plus you always have you social life, where you can chat and connect with players all around the world! This is a great, Must - get game.
Now i have a couple of questions and wishes. First off, could you please add some capes? If this came up in the next update, this would really re-ignite my passion for the game. Second, could you add horses? Being able to ride horses would certainly  make hundreds of players joyous. Thank you for all your time and fun, and keep working on this game! It's a winner, and i shall continue to support it so long as you continue to support us with your quick yet wonderful updates! ;)"
There are no sound effects.
Spent several months and over $220 on the game just to log in and get a message that mu account was disabled. Have yet to hear back from their support. One thumb mobile lost a patron for life.
I have been playing this games since early 2012 and it only gotten better I hope it proceeds to do so
Really so fun in the game
This game is amazing! But like one guy said u have to buy platinum with real money to keep up. The graphics rrr ok. Pretty good for what it is though. Needs more armor and weapon choices. Overall its a great game worth playing
Really good game you just have to watch out for scammers
Good game ,I love it . But I didn't sleep for two days cause of this game .(it's worth it) really fun!!!!
The graphics are terrible it looks like a step up from the Atari. Fight could be better and the option to just hit a CPU should be there instead of tap and hit. Add more variety of character options.
Its a great game 5/5 and I can't wait to see the next update. I do know that a lot of people want a transfer but that really shouldn't be needed seeing as u can just make a lvl1 in every world to see what they are like then train in the world u liked the most. Also i do think a daily reward would be cool but if u need gold then buy plat items with natives and sell them. If natives does not give u ur plat then email them. IT WORKS!!
"I love your game but you need to ad the following

Jumping

New types of people

Better customization and no ugly people"
If you play this game you're gonna have to pay a few $100 bucks but tone honest its worth it. Its one of the best games in the AppStore. So if you don't have the money well... Goodluck
I hate my life this game has ruined it....
You will stop sleeping, stop going to work, stop eating, and stop drinking. You will forget you ever had a life before this game. All you will do is play this game and it will become your new life. Also fyi Mabon is the best server and Guthix is the top clan there.
It's been so long otm doesn't care for their players don't download my account hasn't been enabled and my main character hasn't been replaced heads up for all DO NOT GET I WASTED 800$ so make sure u don't get !
It runs smoothly even on iOS 5 on a iPod 4 great graphics immersive gameplay and unlimited inventory the best part you can have around 16 characters 2 for each of the 8 worlds a definite download
"The community varies from server to server, the graphics are pretty good, the items are mostly decent with a few illogical stats, and the economy varies but for the most part normal. 
However, the set up really is ""pay to win."" Items prices are made based on the amount of gold top players have, buying platinum with real money is necessary if you want to keep up, and balance between classes is nonexistent. Spell-casters really have no chance anymore and it would seem One Thumb Mobile takes advantage of their need for energy in the form sigils, which is buyable (with platinum aka real money) energy regeneration. If you really want to know what other players think, check out the forums by googling ""Celtic heroes forums."" You will learn a lot."
Great game game events are out of this world, farming is simple, lvling is always fun, most of all great at making new freinds
Amazingly fun game, it requires you to play a lot more once you hit a higher level but other than that it's amazing, I personally believe it is much better than Order and Chaos and other Competitors.
Ok, so if you want a good mmorpg for the ipad go play Order and Chaos... Yeah i know its $6.99, but lemme ask you, would you rather spend 6.99 on a game thats actually decent... or play a game that has crappy graphics, bad community, and a pay to win sort of game... And in celtic heroes, there will be a point where its almost impossible to level up without buying platinum... And the game will force you to buy platinum at a point because its HARD to farm gold. Trust me, dont waste your time, money, and effort on this game! I have played and i realized all the time and money i spent on this game has gone to waste. DONT DOWNLOAD!
This is the game that I play the most. To the people that  say getting gold is too hard: deal with it. I've never bought any plat and I'm nearly level 150. It just takes time to farm gold, so don't complain.
It's a great game but gold is like ridiculously hard to get, and no one wants to play in groups much, so my pure support druid is screwed =\ please make team gameplay more rewarding so people will want to group up
"Get it get it get it get it get it get it get it get it...
Got it yet?"
Hacking. And $200 dollars plus 1.5 years of gameplay down the drain. They won't even touch the hacker or give back stuff.
"I have played since release, I'm a level 184 and have experienced it all...! Amazing game 5/5* here.

Been playing since game started and still cant stop playing :) great job OTM!!!
I think u should make an update with nice hats and easy quests from Ito
It's a very addicting game but it needs better graphics
"Is outstanding with over the top graphics that flow so smoothly,but lack of weapon drop with over expensive items tend to leave you frustrated. It is a great game with an epic journey hack and slash fill;is worth playing. 
       Needs a update on emotes,charms,and maybe more classes. 
         Absolutely fun packed times        ahead."
This game i had since 2011 and its been da best one yet.If u wanna find me im on World Lugh and lvl 132 and my name is Dominic4342 and i have Dragonlord armor and a 40% dragonstaff and almost 400k gold
I have been playing this game and loving it. It was running great but then just crashes? My internet connection is perfect and no other game does this whenever I log on I go to type a message and the app just closes itself I'm very disappointed I hope you can make an update and somehow fix this for me
I'm liking this game
Great game, one of the best out there!!
Idc what anyone says, this game is perfect keep up the good work OTM! By far the most addicting game I've ever played!
This game is awesome and amazing and i dont think daily gifts need to be added and mobs dont need to spawn faster.This game is supposed to be fun and people saying this game is crap shut up this game is awesome but one thing you could add is at least a shorter item use time like 5 seconds but you dont need to add a 5 second cool down
Im downloading games but it will not give me any platinum it stinks I'm saving for fashion but i'm getting 3 gold a kill i need 2000
Don't even download it.
Its a good game but u sould allowe us to be able to go on any survers with the same caracter and LET MOBS DROP MORE GOLD its hard getting gold in the game but other then that AWESOME GAME!!!!!
Good game
Awesome Game, im a lvl 145 Warrior. And its still very fun
Why can't I play this game. I wanna play it though.
This game is totally epic!!! Stop wasting time and download it right now. Take my word for it. 6 stars!!!
This runs smoother than any other mmo i've played on IOS. It's simple to pick up if you've played any kind of mmorpg before. And it lets me and my Gf play together :) just fix the faces and helmets >~< anytime you put a helmet on your person goes bald
I agree the items the amor the weapons need to be less expensive and daily money'! I'm only gonna give this 5 stars just for this!
U guys for the new update need to put transfers items to different worlds and for the stamps do like all world stamps but they will like cost 500g each  plz do it need transfer
Best game ever !!! It's so fun and addicting idc how much I spend on this game because its so fun !!!!!!!!!!!!
its a beutiful game me and my friends play alot but... i got cheated out of 24 platnum and would like to get it
I think It's a great and fun game . You could make new friends . Do lots more !<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0080><f0><U+009F><U+008C><U+0088><f0><U+009F><U+0099><U+0088><f0><U+009F><U+0099><U+0089><f0><U+009F><U+008D><U+0097><U+26C4><U+FE0F><f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008C><f0><U+009F><U+008D><U+0092><f0><U+009F><U+008D><U+0095>
This game is amazing. I got some suggestion for you. Could you make gold easier to get? Because I get little bit of gold everyday. Also can you make a daily like first day earn 100 gold. Second day earn 150 gold. Third day earn 10 platuim and 100 gold. It would make it more better for the game. 5/5
This game is breathtaking. Always improving and can't wait to see what's next. 5 stars.
Best game on App Store! Play it
It was a ok game at first but then it kept saying server disconnected every time I logged in even though my wifi was working. So if you buy it try it but if it says bug fixes in updates try it. But otherwise good adventure game.
Because it takes a LOT of space but is fun gold is a challenge to get is very possible to get overall a great game
The best game ever!!!!!!!??
This game is extremely fun and entertaining for almost all ages
It's the best rpg I've played ever but you don't get enough gold of kills change that and I would be happy :)
Boring
Best game on wammearth questionable even to minecraft its so good.....if u like the multiplayer games that u get to do whatever u want kill or love people do it!!! Just a plain out masterpiece
Bad bad bad bad
*****
Awesome game,  surprised it doesn't cost anything :)
i love this game i have been playing it since 2011 and it just take up my time
Nice!!!
First. It is way to difficult to make money, receive quality drops, and level up combat levels around level 60. Everything is great
This mmo tops all,even order and chaos.The servers are like neighborhoods .All the server gossip,communication,and help ties this app off.all give stars from me
"It is a very good game.i give it 5 stars for its extremely well thought out multiplayer system and storyline and how they mix so perfectly.I do hate the fact rangers are SOOOOO underpowered.... They have low armor compared to warriors huge amounts...low damage compared to mages warriors rogues and even sometimes druids.This needs to be touched up on...maybe remove the change  on bolas to 30 seconds

Plz touch up on us rangers thx"
I wish that there was a boggan mob that sells boggan charms that look like the pale ones at carrowmoretunnels and sells them there
I suggest Order of Chaos its better by so much, but this game is alright
It's good but there's one complaint mages are so op(over powered) I'm level 36 and I have good weapons and armor and I was killed by a low level mage even though I was low on health it's kinda sad
The only things I would change are; the controls, and the graphics. I would make the controls easier to manage and upgrade the graphics a couple notches.
This is an ok game but you should add more races and classes.
This game really does deserve a 5 star rating!!
This games prices are way to high I spent 300 dollars on this!and that is preposterous!you only get a few gold from each kill!and you should make a lot more classes!
This game needs better features like mounts or pets
Would be great if you could add horses. I love how you can mail between characters. It is a really great game.
A lot of people are saying daily gold would be nice. Theres the gladiator quest in the arena that gives you gold. It depends on what level you are though.
The support never responds to anything in this game. This game is all based on how much money you have and one thumb mobile is greedy. One clan on server controls everything so you will not be able to advance at all unless you join a bunch of spoiled kids using their parents credit card. Dont waste your time with game its a waste of money and one thumb mobile wants it all cause they are greedy!!!
Hi i love this game
"This game is awesome but I lost my account just lost a level 116 warrior.
I sent email to them about 4-6 months ago and no reply. Support is really terrible but the game is awesome and fun."
Boss game I love it :3
I have played this game for a very long time I just want to say one of the best games in the store it never gets old I love it
good game it's like a real mmorpg on the phone which is cool. Only thing is it kills my music when i open app so I can't play it with its stupid sounds.  Please allow me to listen to my own music. 2 stars and deleted til then.
Best MMO game i have ever played even if it was my first one.
I like the game but I wish they would add pets and mounts
I downloaded this game and it stopped downloading and wont download any more <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1>
When i kill something the EXP it gives is around 2k on most games and to most people thats a lot....not at all my EXP meter barely moves and the money in the game is so hard to get...if you could make everything cheaper or at least make it easier to get money in this game would be a WHOLE lot better and some people who read this will be like "It's just to make the game harder a little more challenging" but once you play this game and find that you enjoy it except for the EXP and money gains your gonna see that i was right...other than that GREAT GAME keep the updates coming
This game is the best..just add more monsters and make it fair to people who jaut started :) and make gold easier to earn
I've been playing this game since it first came out almost 3 years ago now and I love it. I am lvl 180+ and I still cant put it down. However, when you get to the higher levels in app purchases help but not necessary  as you can buy items with in game gold. Very great game highly recommend!
I waste my life on this game it's so amazing imma level 45 mage on arawn and I love it you don't have to pay money to get platinum you can just do offers which is amazing there's fashion and charms to make yourself unique clans so you get help with just about anything if your with the right people but just a few ideas then you get 5 stars separate chats in different tabs so that it isn't all in one spot instead of being color coded make gold easier to get instead of having to play for 2 hours just for 20k and that's if you know the secret give more of a tutorial to noobs let there be more events more frequently halfway through you already have the rarest item if you wanted it also for some people it takes them a year to get level 70 or so and others a month to get to 80 please make it easier to level without elixers give a brief description of each  class and let players comment on a class so that noobs can get a players view of a certain class and daily rewards would be awesome once you put one of these in you then get 5 star
"This is the best game a ever played.
this game is almost just like the game Runescape!!!!
But it should have more hair styles, classes and a place where you can report on players that are breaking the rules.
THE BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Great MMO
the mmo 3d is amazing as he'll well shah
I'm trying to create an account on my ipad and the only thing I can choose to put in for my account is the password I can't put in a username or confirm password
Fantastic game! I really like playing it. i just have one suggestion, add nighttime                                 to it
Do not download weps are too expensive and people ALWAYS scamm u do NOT get.
"Parents beware!!!! If you don't want your kid bullied verbally do not let them play this game. Other players use very strong language usually at other players. I will not allow my 12 yr old son play this game anymore because of this reason alone.  Oh yeah do not bother to complain to support they rarely respond or do anything to offending players even with screen shots.

For hard core MMROPG players, the worlds/zones are small. Game play starts out cool but gets extremely boring quick. Game play is easy to learn and east to level characters. You will be able to level your toon to 180+ in a month or so, max level is 200. I have 3 toons; 183 mage, 177 rogue, and 170 ranger. I have not been playing long so that should give you an idea. Graphics are decent for a mobile RPG. 

Here are the biggest draw backs. There is no limits on clan size so if you find yourself on the outside you will never be able to upgrade armour or weapons as the largest clan will camp the bosses 24/7.  As stated before zones are small so not much to do once you reach level 170+.  You will find yourself spending most of your time waiting for bosses to spawn with competing clans.  Your chances of winning the boss lock is slim to none so total waste of time since you wait in one location for 30-45 mins for each boss to spawn.  Bosses do not spawn randomly they are timed usually a 1 to 1 1/2 hour spawn times. There are only 7 real bosses so pretty lame. If you decide not to boss hunt then the game is extremely boring and slow because there is nothing to explore or do. You will find yourself sitting in the castle doing absolutely nothing.

I have played RPG games for many years so my experience with the game has been disappointing to say the least.  My overall grade is a D, I would have giving an E but the graphics are decent.  The game would be much better if the developers limited clan sizes to 50 players each to give other players a chance to upgrade armor and weapons."
great game, played since it first started-new updates actually making it harder to level up when it was hard enough/everyone likes a little challenge though right?
I think the game should add pets so they can follow u and stuff and my players name is carlosking and u should put dragons if u add pets and ill rate this game  a 5 star cause its fun and other people around the should play it
I have. Said some great things about other apps, BUT THIS... JUST KNOCKS ALL THOSE OTHER APPS OUT IF THE PARK!!! You can have multiple classes to choose from, make your character a boy or a girl (unlike those sexist apps where if you want to use magic you have to be this girl with oversized boobs) BUT THIS IS NOTHING LIKE THAT BEST GAME ON THE PLANET!!!!
Cool game
You should really put in the option to quit quests. Some of them get old and then you are unable to complete them. That's just one example. You would get that last star if you added that
When you are lower level, the game is fun leveling up. Now that I have 2 toons up to 180+ it is quite boring for me, but overall for sure a good game.
Needs work in money making and Xp because it take for ever to level up from 32 to 65 and stuff needs to be a little cheaper ,overall fun game. Needs work because it does get boring.
"Its a great and really fun game but i think it needs some additions like a daily prize and something like a level organized tournament section in arena where u get prizes for wining add that and the game would be even better. Also maybe some more mobs to kill for players level 100 or lower.
Still a great game!"
Wont even  open
Be care full when downloading this game, it's very addictive.
If you havent played this game then you should download it right now i can promise you its worth it. Best game ever!
The game is awesome and addicting, but i think there should be a daily reward system thing where u can earn gold and platium more easy. Repost something related to daily reward systems if u agree :)
Love this app nj
"I played this game back when it first came out, and man was i impressed. I loved runescape back in the day but never got back on because i do more console and iOS gaming. Celtic heroes blew me out of the water with amazing maps (we will talk about that in a minute) character customization, combat, class choices, graphics, and addictiveness. I redownloaded this to find that they added a BUNCH of new
Worlds, as when i played, there was only 4. 
Pros:
Fun
Good overall MMO
Cons:
A TRUCKLOAD of online daters. 
Money system in game is weird
Random crash when in the middle of a huge battle
Jerk high levels that always go after the noobs

So for my conclusion, onetouch mobile did a FANTASTIC job for their mmo. Definately a great playable game. MUST-PLAY"
I try to rest my password and to get help but nothin works this game is crap pls I got scammed of all my stuff I need help I have a lvl 69 worrer I can't get back my dam password don't work and it won't let me rest it >:-( o and I forgot I got scammed of all my stuff 43 times don't ask I easy to trick
"Now all you need to add is better sounds and more classes such as...

A henchman class wheir you can summon allies when ever you whant and be able to upgrade them to wheir they have more powers to fight and buff/debuff and heals and maybe that will be a amazing update and maybe a necromancer class that would be cool don't you think and add more stuff to buy with platinum and maybe you should add every month we will git 5 platinum"
This game is AWESOME but I was wondering if there was a way for players to get more variety of mounts. That plus more actions for their avatar-such as sitting, shrugging, etc. Thanks guys!
Awesome but it is hard to get gold and need more map
Needs pets to fight with other wise it's pretty good
Everyone play this game.. I'm on the world lugh and my name is XxTHExROGUEx
Hi I am awesome +Chase i have a complaint. A lot of times the app keeps exiting out when I am in the middle of playing. You need to do something about now. Thank You! Hurry.
This game is absolutely terrible. It starts off pretty fun, but after a little bit of advancement, you find out that you are seriously unfit to do the quests or even kill mobs that are your level... That is unless you buy platinum, which is extremely expensive. Combine that with extremely stingy amounts of gold drops (lvl 10 and lvl 70 mobs all drop similar amounts of gold LOL), and you get a game that is rigged to your disadvantage. Those super high lvls with the amazing gear, just ask them. They even brag about spending 1000's of dollars to get what they got (And no I'm not kidding!)! One of the worst mmorpgs on the App Store!
first my character was Druid and I was so sad. because it was pure pure Druid. I never seen in mmorpg game that Druid so helpless.. and this game is unreasonable because my character was 15 lvl and I had quest I need to kill lvl 28 monster?? I have 156 hp and he hit me a 140 O_o amazing game O_o
This isnt just one of the greatest games ever, it IS the greatest game ever!
"I love it cant stop playing it
But some ideas my friend and i had is maybe there could be houses u can buy and design also maybe you could like buy furniture and flooring also i think it would be amazing if you could buy a pet that could help you fight like a Dog or a horse or even mythical creatures like unicorns also the profanity glitches out for me also maybe change the landscape for seasonal stuff like during   the winter make it so the landscape is snowy during
 the fall make the trees have no leaves during the spring an  during summer make there leaves and flowers and all type of that stuff"
I love the game all in all but gold could be a lot easier to get at lower levels. It would help or at least lower the initial gold prices for most items cause i would like to focus on lvling more than gold farming. Wouldnt that be nice?
I quit a while ago but if u want to be good in the game dont trust anyone and dont do nothing bad because when u lose your reputation it stays like that forever. Enjoy the game and have fun!
Is there sleds in this Christmas event?
This game is awesome i recommend it.
The game is a beautiful creation of a game, don't worry about the update the worlds will be back on soon as possible. I think this game has cool stuff cool carecters and ok people real people to play with so get it!!!!!!
Ever since I updated the last version, the August update, I've been shut out of the game right after the title screen. Please help!
I love this game it's awesome so fun please update to chirstmas I HAVE 250 PLAT TO USE THX XD
Lllll
When i first got this game i thought it was pretty great. But the more i played it it really started to get really old and boreing, FAST. This game might be the best MMO on ios, and maby even the best game on ios but i dont think its anywhere near the "best game ever".
I don't like it because it won't let me open up the app and start playing. I have the iPod second generation and this update looks awesome but would not allow me to even go to the log in screen! So please fix this problem!
In order to level you must buy elixers.  Elixers cost money in the platinum shop.  Fun game if you have hundreds of extra dollars lying around.  If not, not so fun.  This is a bottomless pit for your money.  And the best gear is quest gear controlled by usually the top clan on each server. Not a well planned game IMO.  Run away from this one.
This game is very good but the graphics need some work
Awesome game but earning gold is the most slow process ever you REALLY need to speed it up please!! It would make it 5 star
Can u please let us take off all our clothing and let us have the option of taking our underwear and making the  the scrawny wolf hats not rear make the common an make let u get pet adult dragons and u can get them an any color and and let us please have sex on the game and make the portal to the other let us go though when were a lvl 30 an make the sunlit stuff much cheaper and make it night and day and let us also have seasons like snow rain sunny u should also make lions and please let us swim two, and let us all have house already with furnishing and two floors and give us the option to get a house and make the tavern have doors on the rooms and make it in to and real working bar were we can set down and have fun and eat and drink oh and also have virtual children please do that thats all i ask please do that stuff i no its a lot but can u try and do this on your next update please <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008C><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008C><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008C><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008C><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008C><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008C><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0081><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0081><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008C>
I've got through many things and the clans BEST IDEA EVERRRRRR
My warrior keeps losing energy levels need to fix fast
In arena theres a lot of bashing  and im just trying to farm stuff and get daily and farm abiltys and try next glat but ppl r grping on lower lvls we call lvl 180s and they kill eachother so i have thought of a way to stop it: make a signup thing for wars between a bunch of ppl and make it so u cant b killed unless u sign up for the war i have been camping 3hrs max just for 2.2k xp and 100g (strog) and thats just my alt
It keeps crashing on me . I re-installed but no change . Fix . I have an iPhone 4S .
This game is amazing for iOS but one thumb mobile us so money thirsty the only way to get good items is to add money....
Awesome looking helm but you guys should put in lux shop. Please?
You guys should make a cross server arena where you can battle other players from different worlds, would be really cool
This game is like the best game but needs some changes. When someone puts 100 dollors into a game they shouldnt just get 20 lvls or 1'good item. Also nativeX does not work for ipad 1.
"I enjoy the game, however i feel that there are two major improvements that could be made.
(1) combat
   I feel that the combat system is insufficient.
While it may be be grand if you are VERY young (like WAY to young to be playing an MMO). It is more than a little bit more than redundant.
Perhaps a more involved combat system than button pushing? Something like infinityblade?
(2) party communication.
I would recommend something like the pvp chat system in metalstorm wingman. Presumably an optional system that taps into the devices microphone, allowing for some king of voice recognition softwareto cut out background noise"
Great game and development team. If they keep going with this a regularly update--this will definitely become a mmo giant.
Seriously great RPGs
Need to get gold a lot easyer but other then that good game
I've never played a better MMORPG on a mobile device. This is the real deal! It's not Super HD. But you forget about graphics once you Are sucked Into this amazing world! It would be nice if we could get gold easier from quest though (: but it's not a problem atm
Had it for 6 days so far and I love it! So far so good
This is a smooth running, fun, and addictive game. I've never had any problems with it, and enjoy playing it with friends. Gold is a bit difficult to receive, with complicated quest - witch leads to a fun experience, and involves strategy.
Advise for new players: Read terms and search forum carefully before and during playing, don't get discouraged there is more than one way, learn from your mistakes, you can always start again, very high replay value, any stat points will work but only a few combinations will work for your playing style, skills are suppose to complement stats choose wisely, research before purchasing items using in game currency, real life money not needed to play but does help, always be polite and above all enjoy the game!!! Hope my advise helps :)
awesoem got addicted on the first day i download it. its awesome but can u add home so we could live in and add like crafting materials so we carry or make weapons or potion i would love it very much if u guys added the stuff.great game though nice job
Im sick and tired of this game. To many people trying to scam u! I already got scammed and lost 700k! NEVER PLAYING AGAIN!!!!!
Despite the non-advanced graphics as mentioned as HD this game is completely functional and that's all that matters, I havent played much but I just got done trying order and chaoses F2P model and its overrun with horrible lag people insulting each-other and way too many people. So yeah , until order and chaos works their sheet out just play Celtic because this game is really good.
"The updates change the rules in the game to making it down right nasty to get gold, harder and harder after every update to get gold, items are decreased in gold value after updates, 
at one point u could sell a hunstmen mask and get 1k of gold and at least have a fighting chance, and then came along an update and took that away so fast it was disgusting, this game is based on spending real money which it's relay good at bleeding your pockets dry, disappointing that this MMO has lost it's way and has forgotten why people play theses types of games."
Most definitely a 5 star game, but we need other races besides humans please.
This game was fun until i hit lvl 100.   You can't play unless you buy expensive lux, which is impossible unless you pay for platinum.   I hate using real money for games on my phone.  So unless you have too much time on your hands to farm for gold or endless cash to waste on platinum, then this game is for you.    Oh yeah a lot of "tweens" and teens play, and their petty arguments, and clan wars are unbearable to read so be prepared to use the "block" button alot.
Can u make it ezer to get more gold faster I love it can u make bedder graffics to pls
No just no if u want a real gameplay fun get arcane legions once agen no just no u killed a game
I love RPG MMOs and this one is great!
This is by far my favorite game on the App Store. Great graphics, and really fun to play, especially with friends.
This game is amazing the only bad thing is leveling slows down at level 40-60 but it gets better when you hit lv 100 because then your involved with epic boss battles and get rich also you can get epic new equipment
There is to many scammers on this game dont download it
Needs to get accs back for ppl who lost.! I lost my 107 with full diamond and venom.
Awesome game!
This is a good game but there aren't that many sounds. If sound FX and character voice were added that would be nice. Also the graphics aren't the best so those should probably be updated.
This is very fun. There is PVP and quests. Multiplayer and chatting. Another good thing is there is a variety of worlds and they are different by a tad or more and perfect for adventure lovers!
Great Game I'm addicted just please make it easier to get gold
"A lot of things cost too much and low levels have a hard time getting money.
Also the special events tell you to collect a lot like 100 for special things when there isn't much to find the objects for the mission. There's like 20 in the whole map but there is a lot of people too."
I love this game so much!!! I was mad at first because I forgot my old account info but it's so much fun I don't even care lol highly recommended!!!
you guys should add a way to get platnum without offers or buying like a daily bounus and mak all wardens gear unlockable at 60
The game is awesome <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008E> I can't stop playing im addicted to it<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00B3>. But it needs new things like new places, weapons, armor, and skills! Maybe even a enemy arena we can play with our friends it would have different rooms with our friends and fight to gain coins, exp. and weapons! Overall it's awesome can't stress that enough!<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0087><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0087><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0087><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0087><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0087><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0087><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0087><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0087><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0087><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0087><f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008D><f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008D><f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008D><f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008D><f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008D><f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008D><f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008D><f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008D><f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008D><f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008D><f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008D><f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008F><f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008F>

Love the game but when I go to earn platinum, it doesn't work!
Amazing game!! It's just like a online computer game on the go. I am literally addicted. And I just got this game yesterday.
This is the best for kids and for all the other people out their that like medieval games please write a review thanks!
If you ever enjoyed RuneScape, this game will soon be your favorite. It's very similar in combat style but much, much better. Overall the game is very well done, especially for being a mobile game.
Celtic heroes is the best game ever! EVERYONE IN THE WORLD MUST PLAY THIS GAME!
They won't give me my account back!!!!! I asked a year ago they never answered me back!!!!
Im fallyall from lugh and i lost all my regens and dragonstaff can somone please help me get my stuff back
This game is a joke, horrible story, horrible graphic. LoL, sooooo bad it hurts to play. Its extra boring.
"Great app, I play almost everyday. Just a few comments...

I think horses should become a rideable animal. Horses that add defense, attack, speed, etc, just like dragonstaffs and the such.
Also, the gold/platinum situation. I believe either gold needs to be easier to obtain, items need to be more available/cheaper, or platinum should not cause such a big difference in ability to play.

Otherwise, great game. I love it, love you guys. By the way, Taranis is the best world :3"
The gold amount at a high is only at 10 when you kill a level 35 and the amount of gold you need for a dagger is 2000+ and it took me about 3 hours to get to level 10
"I love it amazing game.
Just keep out the players who try to make scams on other players. Also add daily gold/platinum reward."
Why did you block off the lake that you could get into? It wasn't hurting anyone it was just fun for some people who know about it. You know of it before too during the last anniversary event with the presents and crowns you put a green present in there. You knew of it before so why block it off now?
Fun game. Just don't trust people until u have known them for a while, and u won't be crying about getting scammed by people.
Okay. For the record, this is a fun game. It definently has good graphics and a good storyline. There are some problems though. Things are getting really expensive. This is changing with new gear as it brings the market price down, but it is still fairly hard to get gold, although I believe gold drops have increased. NEW PLAYERS READ THE GUIDES ON THE WEBSITE FOR YOUR CLASS! DONT JUST BUY ANYTHING BECAUSE ITS BETTER OR IT LOOKS SHINY! SAVE UP FOR ANC WEAPON, THEN JUST WAIT TO BUY LUX, WARDEN, AND DIAMOND. Also, there is some scamming, but not as much as some people say. Overall pretty good game.
Game is full of scammers and bullies.  Developers refuse to enforce their own terms and conditions.  There is gambling for items sold in real life money, which probably violates a law or two.  There aren't basic MMORPG things like server transfers and auction houses.
You better get this game or you will miss out on a lot!
Keep it up OTM! This is like the only game I play when I have wifi!!! Idefinitly reccomend this app for everyone!
This is the best game ever. But can you please add daily rewards and a new character like a assassin or goddess. But literally best game ever.
Super hard to get gold. Plus how about some dungeons where you and your friends are forced to work together to take down a giant boss and get epic loot.
I mean really the ancient plate pants look nothing like the plate pants i think you should make the ancient plate pants look like the plate pants but gold the scale stuff look alike why don't the plate pants?
I've been playing this game a few days after it was released so far best game i have and I will never began to comprehend how fun it is
Great game
As you progress in the game, you will have no choice but to spend $100s in elixers and other purchases to level up, or spend hundreds of hours leveling up and grinding for gold. After you get past   Lv 80, there are virtually no quests to do to level up on. So have fun spending hundreds and hundreds of hours getting to lv 190 on nothing but killing mob after mob. And on top of that, mob gold drop amounts basically don't even go up throughout the game. You can get the same pathetic amount of gold from a lv 50 mob as you can from killing a lv 140. So good luck getting gold as well. I had to quit the game because it was simply taking up too much of my time. Spending 6 hours to lv up one lv on a mobile game is just ridiculous. Especially when the end game content is at a whopping lv 190 and rising.
It's a really cool game besides at the start. That part is pretty boring. Great for online play too. The only problem for me is not being able to quit side quests!
Cant talk to people to complete the quest
"I love this game and they do bribe you to rate 5 stars, however the gameplay is cool just a few things they need to add and I will move my star up to five. 

I star lost=1 improvement needed!

1. Capes- I looked it up celtic heroes have capes!

2. Pets- wouldn't that be cool and I bet they had pet dogs in Celtic times.

3. Better skill LOOKS- The skills look like they hardly worked on it. Wouldn't it be cool if you could jump up and throw your sword into the ground.

4. Add more inventory- 20 spaces I am good with, but 10 OMG how am I supposed to fit EVERYTHING in that small thing.

Now I know I know what a little bit of programming is like. The one letter bugs and all, but if you could brings these up I WILL SAY YOUR THE MOST IMPROVED APP EVER!!!!"
This game is amazing, when i started playing i couldn't even stop playing. I love the graphics and how the characters look and the armour and weps.
This game is like the best there is on the App Store. And I've played this game a lot. So I just want to say keep up the awesome work u guys are doing great
It's a very fun game but there needs to be more gold drops since everything good is expensive
Worst game i've ever played, OAC is wayyyyy better. Plus this "huge update!" did nothing. Looks bad, runs bad, terrible 8 year old community, just terrible overall. Not worth a look. Just get OAC.
You guys need to create a reward system that each day u are given a random gold reward. And you should make money drops much bigger!!! I'm a lvl 30+ and i only have a couple thousand gold. It's so hard to get it:(
Although it is a very cool, and fun game, it only has one or two, i guess "lands" you could say (not meaning like two city's.) There are better morph games, but very few
THE BEST GAME . ya gold is a little slow,but it is my favorite mmo EVER!!! cool if you could get platinum in quests,lol.;)
It's really fun. The only problem I think there is, is that it's super slow on getting coins. If money would be easier to get this game would dominate all others
This app is all I hoped it would be when I downloaded it my search for an endless rpg is over this has taken the place of arcane legends which has recently descended into a world of greed by spacetime studios this is my new favorite game!!!
This game is extremely addicting and fun, but only downer about the game is the gold drop system.... Small amounts of gold killing mobs and time consuming. While the all the good stuff is EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE!!!!
Best game for the apple products i think. Great job with this game
"This game is way better than most MMO out there in the App Store.

 I really enjoy it, however, they should add for features such as ""Jump"" and a shortcut to open the map."
Gameplay is fun, although to really do well you need to spend real $ on the game... This leads to wealth and good items, which makes you a perfect target for scammers... People who ruin the game by stealing/tricking other innocent people out of their items or gold or both. They ruined it for me, I have complained to support, but they did nothing so DONT TRUST ANYONE. NOBODY.
If u love to get scammed play this game i recomend never trust any1
Make sure to get it. I bought several in app purchases not because I needed them, but to support the developer. Simply fantastic. Easy controls, great storyline, awesome customization, nice graphics, and it being an mmo just puts the icing on the cake. Absoulutely astounding.
It needs to have transforming like if you beat 50 of the same enemy it drops a power or you can buy it also you get it's powers.       Over all AWESOME
Was scammed someone said they would give me a great item for my blue sunlit and white suit and staff but never got item or my stuff back .  Please help im jxd . If you see me please help
"Put in otherworld a zone called celtic fear right at wardens place

And im in world taranis NEWrougePOWER"
My first and only MMORPG so I have no real baseline but I love meeting new people and having a cool place to retreat after work. The banking system is horrible and there is no way to in game auction (so bad I can't give 5 stars) but that aside, this game affords me hours of enjoyment each week.
Very addictive game just make a daily reward and increase gold amount and experience  amount most important to do is the daily award and the gold amount really need to increase it great game though very addictive keep up the great work though
"I think the game is awesome but duskshadow gloves quest doesn't work
And I agree about the gold thing you need to give at least 50 gold"
I got locked out of my account and I forgot to register my email MAKE A WAY TO RETRIEVE YOUR PASSWORD EASIER
Like I said before, this is my game of the year, but uh, no nothing new with this update, maybe a few bug fixes but nothing that big, keep it up one thumb! Great game<f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008D>
If u do Facebook to get platinum why do u only get one for all the stuff they post?
Lover the game been playing long time love new upgrades. Wish people would realize just a game not real life.
It's a very fun game we need to be able to earn gold a little faster
Is a very fun game really good graphics but is a little complicated at higher levels.
Dont see anything new!!!
So addictive
Best game I've played :))
There's none
"Graphics are now HD, but not better.
Gameplay is fun game is fun, it's all fun (:"
"What the update was talking about when it mentioned ""Enhanced HD Graphics"", because there is no increase in detail, as I've seen on my iPad 2.  

I literally took a screenshot before I updated, in-game, and after I updated, and there is no difference in the graphical quality at all. 
;-;

Otherwise, the rest of the update is pretty cool."
The game is really cool, but the girl character is completely gross looking, which is really annoying, which makes me think that this game is more geared toward guys, which is completely unfair- more people would play if the characters were more flexible
"The game is an amazing MMO that everyone should atheist try! It's a revolutionary way to enjoy online gaming! The graphics are amazing and the community is very warm and welcoming.

INAPP PURCHASE BEWARE!
The app purchase system doesn't work most of the time, so whatever you buy doesn't even show up in the game yet they take your money...the support team is extremely slow to solve your issues. I've purchased platinum nearly 3 weeks ago and have yet to see an apology or explanation."
Seriously ...
I've been playing this game for a while and people say that there is pets and there is mounts I don't really know but I will really love this game if it does.
Best MMO on iOS. And the gold thing is fine.. this game is all about challenges.
Brilliant Update all the crashes are fixed and I can get back to bossing with my Clan!!!
Its a really fun game but it doesnt have the best graphics but if your the type that likes fun games and dont care about graphics this is the game for u.
I went to the fairy shop and i wanted a yellow sparkly fairyqueen charm  but it doesn't have a yellow one! It has a yellow for the princess but not for the queen itz making me not happy , also can u put in a new feature: angel wings but just the wings not a whole suit, make it so that u can attach it whenever u want please, but anyway u guys are the best game makers ever it is sooo worth the download trust me im picky about games ! Download it!
I tried loading the game but it won't load!
It won't let me sign in because it says I have the wrong password even though I have remember password on and it's already there! I was really looking forward to playing this game!
IM MAD BECAUSE SOME ONE SCAMMED ME FOR OVER 100k WORTTH OF STUFF HIS NAME IS iHEAL and he goes on morrigon the world and bann him becaus he took all of my stuff and if you dont do anything about it you better at least give me the 75 bucks i spent on this gane NOW<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1>
It's good, but the people on here who have higher levels are horribly mean...
Fun-ish game but so slow and too much dialogue can you make it easiar to walk or just make the graphics good? :3
This is a perfect game and you can play online with real people its just like world of Warcraft easy controls BEST GAME EVER
IT WON'T LET ME ON ALL THE WORLDS ARE RED!
Woke up to new update this morning - downloaded and installed, then server status showed all servers down. powered down ipad and restarted - same thing. Uninstalled game, went to i store and now I can't even download game from i store. I think update borked your servers... pls fix!
You guys should add the arrows on our backs cuz the character is just creating arrows from thin air...
Graphics are amazing, so is gameplay, could you add lycans and vampires as power that can be gained?
Tried to register and log on.  Said I had wrong name or password.  I had the right name and password but it wouldn't let me. Uninstalling and looking for another mmorpg.
This isn't a good game I was looking for. I was looking for a game like arcane legends but with better graphics then ths game, because I don't like how when u walk, run, attack, skills, and/or its less players.
They should come out with a update that it is dark at certain places or times
Can't login at all a must fix
Crashes past the loading screen on iPod 4, used to work just fine, fix it
This game is a real good game I have played it for a year now and it's pretty good I stopped tho cuz my friend fire heart (a girl)
Really fun game!i have a iPod 4 and it works perfectly
"Fix the Internet connection! Every time i fight a guy all of a sudden there are red numbers in the bottom right hand corner then 10 seconds later, it says ""no Internet connection"" than 15 seconds later, the games stars acting normal but its irritating!!!! Fix it, im giving it 1 Star for this.

PS: make gold easier to get."
This is a game u can play all day. It's  addicting if u put ur mind to it its not really hard to gain money and lvl up this is a game i can trust. The only thing i would suggest is new classes, ridable and usable creatures (just like the brooms and dragon staffs except fast creatures), more main quests to help lvl up quicker, more item availability to the poor, and easier ways to get platinum like watching clips downloading other apps and from quests.
This is literally the best game I've ever played on the iPhone. And it's even better than most console games I've played. I totally recommend this. AWESOME <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0083><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0083><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0083><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0083><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0083><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0083><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0083><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008D><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008D><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008D><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008D><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008D><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008D><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008D><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008D><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008D><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008D>
Why is the quest tracker not on for my ranger I just started the game today it's fun but it doesn't show me where I'm supposed to go please tell me why
"Should have more gold update

Cooler armour (make cheap)!"
"This is the best app in the App Store. Period. There are come scammers but dont give away ur items or password and u can't be scammed or hacked. All of u join server danu we are awesome. We have only 1 scammer but he keeps account trading and since our server buy plat, we always have elixirs and idols and pots. Also if u lag, lower the draw and detail distance sliders in the options. 

One suggestion OTM. Just please add the heroic energy and hp regen ammys back. Not just rejuv"
Well, I think it will be good... But I can't login and I' ll change the rating once I can really play. Update? <:3
Good mmorpg.
I think the game need pets with mount on weapons and armor they can level up like the player does and start of like cubs when on their first level types of pets should be dogs,wolves, and tigers but the animals do not need different skins and it would be nice if the pets could be put away in our inventory and I think the price in gold for them should be at least 1000. Thanks to who ever reads this and puts it in the game.
Though the models and and graphics look like something from an n64, the storyline, open world-linearity mix and creativity make this an astounding game!
I thought the game was ok at first and spent money little by little and then on my birthday i got a 100$ itunes and since i liked this game alot i bought the 99$ plat package and after it took all my itunes money the PLATNIUM was never given to me
This game is fun, people complaining just have trash devices and need to shut up...
This (in my opinion) is the best app ever. It's an mmo on the go. I have never written a reveiw until now. I'm glad that it's on this game.
"Here's a play by play of me using this app:
1. I click on it
2. Wait 2 minutes for it to launch
3. It launches and I login
4. It shows my character, and I click the button to go into the game.
5. It shows the loading screen.
6. It loads to exactly 35% every time
7. then, the screen goes a navy blue and there I am looking at the app with all the others. It has crashed.
EVERY single time from the time I got this app, it has crashed. Every time. Even the first time it crashed during the game. I will rate this nicely when I can ACTUALLY PLAY."
Crashes all the time dont get until they fix of u will get mad.
I just got a sack of platinum for 10$ and it didn't even give me any platinum  i will never rate any higher then 1 star now i want my money back now! To any body reading this dont buy platinum its a $cam (the dollar sing is an s)
I Love This Game! But When I Logged In Today Found My Players Got Erased! Idk How -.- Not Going To Play This Anymore Tho! Cuz It's Going To Take Forever To Get Back to Where I Was! V.V
Cypher100 is a scammer in epona.dont play this game.everythings great until someone scams u then you quit forever
"Best game I play it every day, I've played it since it came out. I've only showed 1 friend about it and he's already addicted and that's literally what he said the first time he ever logged in! 

Hope you keep updating and making it better! Super fun!!

Sure, it's a constantly updating game so it never stays the same, but there aren't enough quests. In the beginning, you have a lot, but eventually you get to the point where you're just level grinding the whole time. You get to a point where you get a new quest every five levels, but it takes a few days to level. This lack of quests make the game lose motive to the point where you almost stop playing.
This game is epic and is a great way to shut someone up
this game is totally fun! but i really love the dogs! i thought it would be cool to have a cheap, loyal, pet that can follow you around! so please add pets and some cheap ones because ik its hard to make money. THANK YOU!
I think more classes would make the game interesting and worth character slots I get tired of playing the same characters tax could go to its quite annoying overall nice game though
Don't waste ur time. Once you create an account it always says inncorrect user or pass.
It has a good gameplay  one of the best mmo games i played on ipod but its to hard to earn money the people need to drop more money and the weapons and armor prices need to be drop  at the store  and need to fix the lag i think the sever may be get over full or something becuse epona sever is laging a lot then it ever did when this updates came out
Play something better these guys don't respect players and high lvls steal kills
Its really a good game 8D i liked it
I type in my password over and over, and it says its wrong! I can't play! It also says my email is "invalid"
This game was really fun as i started to lvl up and gain awesome items, but later on in the game i somehow lost my 2 accounts and all my beautiful items. I worked for about 2 years on this game. I contacted the support group about this and they talked to me for about the first 2 messages and then all of a sudden they didnt want to help me out anymore as it seemed. They never contacted me for a week and i lost my accounts because they either didnt believe it was my account or they didnt want to work and were lazy. This game was fun until they stopped and left me.
Great graphics love dis game recommended !!!!!
I would of the say it awesome but I made and account and it don't even work won't let me even login it's saying that user name or password is wrong and I have put them in 3x over so please fix so I can give a better ratting and review.
Scamming is easier hahahahhahagahga muhahhhahahahha :)
I need something to help know where things are at. And quest are getting to confusing can their be like an arrow
This game is to hard because its to hard to get gold and is to hard to level up and everything is WAY TO EXPENSIVE.

I just downloaded this game, made an account and can't login due to incorrect username/password when I know they're correct. Fix this please so I can try your game out. 1 star until fixed.
This Game is amazing no matter what.But will you add a companion store?A store that you can buy a mercenary or a monster or animal that fights for you also please make it so you can buy or find it?PLEASE do this it will make the game a thousand times better no joke also if you can make it so the loot shows up on a screen and you can take what you want to?It will make the game perfect!!Otherwise I love thank you if you do:)
please add voice support for groups, via headphones with mic
This is the best game I've ever played!!!
This is by far my favorite game on the iOS! Super fun!
I would recommend you get this app of you like warriors we've got warriors if you like rouges we've got rouges ect. Great game!!! Thanks one thumb mobile
The only reason i give this one star is because i made and account and then it says that my password is incorrect even after i type it in like 30 times. Please fix and i promise i will try it and rate it again hopefully with a better rating.
When I log in for the first time it boots me and it happens every time PLEASE HELP
Got banned for no reason and support never answers rather a different game seeing the lack of helping people again worse game dont recommend it annoyed seeing my accounts were banned -_-
Order & Chaos is free now so skip this and get that instead!! Ur welcome.
"This is a good game i haven't played it but i 
got a glicth from the download but i rate it 5 stars"
Badly needs auction house.selling and buying is painfull.
Plz can you make a WAY BIGGER map plz it would be the best thx
This game is great!!! It is perfect if you want a great gaming experience and you don't even have to pay. I am having great fun with this game and I haven't spent one cent. I recommend this game to everyone. Great job one thumb mobile, this is a great achievement!
Got the game yesterday level 14. The graphics could do some fixer-upering. Some standards are high but it's my fav game at the moment. Should be able to fast travel strait the clan members And friends not just Leystones. But anyway. It's the bees knees
"One of my favourite games but have written to them 3 times over two weeks about a login issue and haven't received one answer - not even an automated ticket.

I have spent $60 or so on this game and expect a modicum of customer service.  

DO NOT SPEND ANY MONEY ON THIS GAME."
Love the game, addicting. But the visuals are not, let's say "outstanding". I was playing and a group of my friends wondered why I was playing such a "crappy" game. I know its not easy to make and update games but could I ask for more realistic looking details?
This game is great but it needs more maps.
This is such a great game it's so addicting but it's to hard to gain money on it I'm a lvl 60 rogue and I've only got 3k
"Changing the combat system most likely wont be possible, but this game needs more detail and quality. 

-The quests are pretty boring and feel like chores you do in your house, maybe take inspiration from other mmos and add stuff like, for example, escort quests, instead of just ""go kill these guys"", ""go talk to this guy"", or ""pick these mushrooms"".
 
-More options need to be character creation. There's only like 3 or 4 hair styles and face options. Maybe take inspiration from mmos like neverwinter or rpgs like elder scrolls. They have awesome character creations.

-I can see that monster designs are improving. Though I still see bosses which are just normal monsters, but scaled up and coloured red.

-More detail, better textures and improved graphics if possible would also be nice."
I paid for the $0.99 for 10 platinum and I didn't get anything, this is bs, give my money back!!
This game is friggin epic.
I'm not a hater it's just really annoying getting money stuff is so expensive but still good but the recommend mmo is Order And Chaos
I dont know why i used to love this game and now i dont :( this was an awesome game i used to love having fun with freinds now mostly everyones all serious about things maybe thats why if anyone else is bored and if you find a way to make u like unboared pls tell me in game name is P3R1SH im on arawn pls mail me how
Just like to tell everyone how great this game is. I have been addicted to it for a very long time and can not stop playing. Only thing I have found is that it does not seem like you get your value for money when purchasing plat. It would be great if double plat offers occurred more often or the quantity of plat was increased for the same amount of money. Apart from that it is an extremely addicting game :D. my in game name is joshdapro a lvl102 ranger in Morgan or my lvl51 Mage ATM come and say high and join our clan Cassiopeia :)
"The game is amazing although, the ""Support"" we have really isn't that helpful I somehow managed to get hacked last year and lost a golden fire trident, 75k, a quarts sword, flint chestplate and an ancient greatsword. That was a real devastating moment and yeah. Though I have started saving up again (Level 84, currently with 50k earning 10k a day) I still have to say the Support has done absolutely nothing so far. Some admins may come on twice a year for a joke around but never do anything serious. I also believe that gold price of items are really good and reasonable and don't need to be changed. I also believe that gold drops are perfect too, bosses drop around 1k and up to any amount of gold in items depending on the level/impact of the boss and when it comes to farming, higher level enemies DO drop more gold. Example pirates, bam they drop heaps in manuels and rings. To sum it up, the game is going great. Good job One Thumb.
Can't wait for the new engine!"
CH is incredibly addicting and fun, I love the community and I can't wait for the engine update. Only improvement I can think of; HORSE MOUNTS
You need to make getting money easier it takes so long to get a decent amount of gol
This game is very good but the game needs to put the prices in stores lower and the game needs to make it easier to get experience points and gold coins. But over all that its a good game.
please u got to change the endures a bit , I am a warrior lvl 70 and keep missing with my giant swing and it's on full skill points.... Please fix
"Very fun, cool and perfect......

So many updates, and some are good some are not takes a little time and its kinda fun"
Very fun game
It is a pretty good game. However it is annoying at the start because u dont really hit anything, the combat sometimes glitches out and the player levelling takes forever. Please fix then i will rate 5 stars
I used the ranger class and it doesn't even hit anything. It takes forever to kill something that's level one so only 1 star
So i bought this golden quiver of ice and when i equiped it it started shooting arrows that were RED. Is that the same to other players? Is it suppose to be like that? Idk its just what I've seen
Awesome game
it keeps crashing for me all the time but otherwise its great :)
i just downloaded and then i had to update it so i did but whenever i open it up the game is black for a while then it gets to the first art work and crashes this happens repeatedly hope you fix this. PS. have a double platinum day like last year i'll buy $50 worth again.
This is the best game ever i really love it , play it everyday. I have loads of games in my device and this is the only one i play it is soooooo good.
Ok here it goes i had this game for like 3 months and i got addicted to it and I was thinking about it at school and I couldn't sleep this game puts to much pressure on you and messes up your life im sorry :(
I don't like this game. I LOVE IT! SOOO... Addicting I can spend hours on it. P.s Can you make the graphics a bit better. CELTIC HEROES IS SO COOL!
I give this game credit for how good it is for a ios game. But I strongly agree with the other players who say that leveling is slow! I think for a fun thing to have would be pets. For exemplar your could have little dragons that u wide around on and when u dismount it follows u around and fights for u. I think this would make the game ten times better! But over all a great game :)
This game is awesome,  keep the updates coming that would be great
"I played this for 2 years or so and thought it was a great game but I found it very hard to lvl... But that was ages ago.
But I got bored and deleted it. Then a few years later I got it again but after 2 weeks I was bored. Add more things that aren't related to armor weapons and stuff that makes you character better.
Add fun stuff! Like mounts (horses) add boats to said around the world and take people on boat rides to earn money and more fun stuff like this for when you are sick of lvling and just want to have fun.

I would like the makers of this game to look at Order And Chaos. This game is a very good example and will give the producers some great ideas.

Over all great game but is boring after a while like I said. Make improvements and you will have great success. :DDDDD 
DragonBirdz"
Very addicting, but it gets really annoying with difficulty and how we need to call on our friends for help. Also can you please erase account who have deleted the game so we can get the names. Also it would be great if the fighting was upgraded, so we would have to press a button to attack rather than watching our character fight and pressing a special attack every now and then, also mages and Druids need to have more attack power for basic attacks. Overall great game.
"Celtic hero's is is a must have mmorpg game for adventures around the world to make friends and build character literally 

Cool game
Shadowkillsu"
This one of the best in while that the App Store has to offer I play it constantly I can't wait till they make another game like this :)

good community on my server, really addicting
I played this 4 hours straight best ios game I've played in a while
I think this game was very well made and it is really addictive and the group and clan aspect is well done. I hope they keep making updates and make the game even better.
The recent patch made it slightly better for mages. Thanks otm.
Great game effectively addictive
And yet still cant log in.
The patch didn't do ANYTHING!
I have had this game for a year and if has working perfectly fine. Just recently I went back to the game and it is still great. This morning a created my second character, a druid. Just now I tried to log in and it would not let me. It said that my username or password was invalid. I know that my login details are DEFINITELY CORRECT!!! Please release an update soon fixing this annoying glitch.
when ever i try log in game crashed fix it.
Every time I go to log in it shuts me out please fix this I really want to play this game.
Celtic Hero's is the best game ever!!!
I downloaded it on IPad and it crashes when u try to load the game when you log in.It happens continuously over and over again.If you can please fix up the bug as it propels iPad players from this game.
"This game is great the update is awesome. It's only a few connection problems. If u fix this will be perfect. Btw world epona is the best 
                           Five stars

I got this app nearly a week ago an distill doesn't work on ipad, I really want to play this but it shuts off every time I start it.
"The Best RPG without a doubt.
It is the only game I play the most. The Update is AWESOME!!
Very entertaining.
But... Stuff cost way too darn much!!
Enemy drops not enough gold to save, which means we must buy in game purchases to get gold. Or. Grind for years.
But you say, it keeps servers running, ok, well worth spending a couple of hundred bucks to get good gear. Jk
Get the iPads working."
Game is awsome but could use a monk character k
WHY IS IT WHEN I LOG IN I ALWAYS PRESS CONTINUE THEN IT GETS OUT THE BEST GAME GOT WORSE
"At the first review i gave 5 stare now one becouse today when i loged in it said account disabled and it never ends i spent 60 dollers on this game and now i got nothing i was sad my account name is moniter and i have a reper charm a vengarda mask etc
And i love those itams and now i cant even plaay the game i played the game for over 1 year its really fun and its really cool but that thing is annoying and plus i recomed mages there really strong and one more thing this should be ages 18 plus cose people say the f word s word and noob and more and some people are drunks and theres to meny scammers i lost lots of stuff. 

When u play this game dont trust ENY ONE ALL MOST 99% of the people are scammers belive me my freind lost 200k and another 150k the next day but he was a bit stuped cose he trusted a level to give it to his other account u usoly do that to high level people ok 
Thats all ur secirly 

                  KEANU HAMZA 
And if jamison reads this read this dowlod it for iphone be a rouge and go to server lagh and my name is xxasasinxx i got a repear 
charm ok.
Guys listen this is my old revie this is my new revie <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008C>: ...dowlod this game is da best in my whole life i its like minecraft but better and no tools im lvl 75 allmost lvl 76 im updating right know i havnt seen the new update AND I WAS KILLING KNIGHT THE INVISABLE AND WHEN IT HAD TWO HEALTH LEFT THE GAME CRASHED well it happed becouse if a new UPDDATE WHOOHOO"
But need to make it so you get like 2 extra gold each kill cause its really does take a lot of time to get gold
Great best game!! Keep up the good work! Fix bugs Update
This game is full of scammers, liars and thieves. The management will offer no support to those affected by scamming. This game is not safe for children as they will surely be taken advantage of. The game it self is a long grind of killing bad monsters in dodgey environments with poor parameters.  All the while having to put up with twice as many scammers as real players. Worst mmo ever!!
I had a lot of fun with this, but if you're looking for a WoW clone go Order and Chaos.
This game is very mad I'm just asking when's the new update out and also why is the Christmas event on i joined in 2011 and was there ever an Easter event? And also who is the owner do they play the game i play on Taranis is SirBlaze the owner
It's a great game good for people who like medieval stuff only things I don't like about it are the controls are a but to much to Amy controls but I can understand for an iOS game and sometimes the quests/missions don't give you enough Information
Hey,my name is lolinfinte in world Rhiannion,pretty mad game u should download.
This game is very boring if you do not pay real money. For the best online IOS experience please try order and chaos online. Order and chaos has very balanced classes and is easy to play without spending real money..... In order and chaos there are quests all the way to max lvl so you don't have to grind. There is also pvp and duels which makes the game very exciting! - professional
I had a 150 warrior and 100 rogue on one account and i didnt tell my password to anyone. I couldnt log in one day. I tried again and everything was gone. They did nothing about it. I had spent about $600 on in app purchases. It is a fun addicting game otherwise. Very expensive if you want to get the best out of it.
Some people think this game is boring well it's not its actually the best game out if u under stand it
I think this app is stupid because there are too many players so I can't make an account.
This is a great gave and is super addictive.  By far my favourite IOS game.  Keep it up onethumb!!!
"Please make a update were there is new land because I'm sick of just 3 places you can go and the other world and please make a lottery type machine were you can bet and random winnings.and for the clans I promoted a guy and I cared demote him and he is never on please make the guy who creates the clan is the top guy in the clan 

My name is nallak and I'm in rennon"
You should make wolves tameable so you can ride them. And also make it easier to level up and get skill points and attribute points. And make other ways to get platinum INSTEAD of paying. Of course make it hard to find.
The game keeps patching things and its been doing this now for three days!!!! It take so long!!!! I haven't even played not once yet!!!!!!!! Heaps angry!!!
Order and chaos is best mmo but this is not far off
not to bad really good grafics great fun need a new update i reakon to get different classes like hunters with pets or knight class and different fasion like a werewolf fasion and make new area anyway thats what i think
Favourite app EVER! Can't stop playing it
Awesome because it's with heaps o people an u can play with them
If you want people to play the game don't make them wait over half an hour the first time they try to load it, I'm giving up on this
This game is wicked i play in the morning and in afternoon . And can i please have any tips for leveling since im only lvl 39
Kill more mobs
Dont listen to anyone else this game is the best for ages i hve need searching for a game like this and i hve found it thankq and keep on updating
When it's downloading the files I always get an error
It is alright for loading its not that long lol
How long does it seriously take to load! Man that should be fixed
How freakin long does it take to log you in?!?!?! <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1>
Such a awesome game and good graphics and its free plus you can make friends upgrade power ups and be in clans this is the best game ever
This game is so fun but a bit hard to start off, it is 100% lag free and I'm surprised it doesn't cost money, one thing it's missing is a bigger map if it had that and horses to ride on it would be awesome it would also be cool if you could delete quests I have no clue why everyone is complaining about losing there passwords or taking ages to spawn or patch pretty simple if u lose your password it's your fault because there is an option to remember it on you device and if your having trouble patching or spawning its because of your Internet and storage space.
Too all people who disagree, if the patching wont work, you need more storage space, trust me guys, this game is worth the space it takes, and yes, it takes a long time to patch but that is because it must create every detail from the peices of grass to all the huge towers and cliffs. it's so addictive, this is now the ONLY app that is run on my iOS (other than App Store). THIS IS A MUST GET!!!!!! Definately deserves the app of the year award, no doubt!
We're did we go so wrong  I mean I hate games that want your password why would u even need it anyway. Oh yeah and celts didn't fight with amour like that in fact they fought naked honest. But i can understand why u dint add that I mean no one wants to see a naked guy fighting
"<U+2728><U+2728><U+2728><U+2728><U+2728><U+2728><U+2728><U+2728><U+2728><U+2728><U+2728>
Guys If it says ' Error Patching (something) size miss match ' then it's sometimes because you don't have enough storage. It happend to me several times. So make sure you have at least 200MB ( maybe more ) of storage, then restart the app and try.

If it says ' Patching error please try again later ' then delete the app and download it again, and make sure you have plenty of Internet/WiFi connection.

Also, Patching taking a long time is normal. It is just patching everything in the game to make it all the better. Just make sure u have plenty of internet/Wifi :)

Hope this helped :)"
Been patching for the past hour and half. Still patching...
I like the game because it is fun and you can sell stuff pretty easy but I find it is hard to make money and without platinum you can't buy all the good stuff like luxury shop items like heroic boots or amulet but it's still a good game.
When ever i start the game and log in it says patching error for Bogan_The_Ragged Size Mismatch
Celtic heroes is a great game overall but whenever I play there is a patching error- now there is a mirrain_seer size mismatch or something, please fix
Every time I try to log it it says error in patching but overall good game.
I can't log in when I try it says "error in patch" and there's a patch name. I patched it all last night but for some reason I can't login from one. "error in background file ip4_loading_backround.png compressed size mismatch.....
This is THE best game I've played im only lvl41 but im enjoying it and i hope for christmas they make it 4Xthe amount of plat u buy
I can't play because its doing patching thing for days wow so I just delete it :(
This game is the best MMO RPG game out of all plz guy make enemies drop more gold its hard to get gold i been playing this game more then a year and its the best game my name is avenger187 in the game world eporna
I launch app and it patches for days. I uninstall/reinstall and it patches for days. I can't play because all this app does is patch.
Cool game and fun
U should have horses as mounts and have a quest for it so everyone can have one
Best mmorpg for the iPhone/iPod/iPad, undoubtedly.
"It's such a great game, with so much to do. It's free, so might as well try it.

[If the patch download doesn't work, reinstall the game.]"
This game is the best MMORPG for iOS so far I've seen and if if you don't like it then get out of here!
G
There's a little bit of a problem when I logged in it says size mismatch any ways to fix it? Overall great game
Good game but currently comes up with a size mismatch error when trying to patch newest version
hey guys great job on the game love the update and the graphics are good as well but there is one thing i would like and would make the game better could you add a new land so you go to the tavern and theres like a guy you talk to and he gives you a quest and then he lets you ride his ship to a new land and that would be the best thing ever please read this and i hope you add it.
:-)
"Good game over all.
The things they should add r like pets and make it easier to get gold like make it from 30 to 300 drops and make it u get 1 platinum per lvling up.
And make enemies easier cause sometimes other players won't help u."
Best game on the iPad !!!   All the developers need to turn this into the best game Eva is to add clan vs clan and pets and mounts also needs more money drops for higher lvls
This game has too many patches, it took me 10-15 minutes just to play this game.
Good game
"This game is by far the best MMO game on the AppStore but it needs some more things. Like cheaper armor and weapons without having to do quests and when you kill things they drop more gold. Also I'd like to be able to tame a puppy or a horse ( I'd like a nightmare ) so that you can ride the horse and the dog could fight with you and follow you around. One last thing, can we please run faster it gets annoying when you have to get to two separate places and you can only run real slow. That's what I want to be added in the next update so anyway PEACE!
PS my character's name is Epictoast."
Great game! Addictive and fun to play!
Best mmo I have ever played on the iPad,but levels get to hard because I don't have enough money to buy anything.
Celtic is a fantastic interactive rpg game! and the best available on the App Store, but I would like to see more features in the game, like capes! Would be really good!,more selection of weapons and armors , more places to buy items, more bosses dungeons, dragons ect..would be great to also see clan events, wars and battles and also the way to get coins could be better, when completing quests would be good to see a higher payout in coins when completed, and when killing they should drop 5 times the amount of coins not just 10 or even less sometimes..but over all it is a great game! and would highly recommend anyone that likes games to give this one a try! I spend hours on this! and I'm sure more awesome features will be added :)
this game is very eddicting but when u get to really hight levels the quests r 2 hard and at shops they sell stuff 4 to much
"Game is really nice n adicctive but the gameplay gets really boring after
Lvl 40.... Not many new things after, they should have more features for clans like clan rankings, wars, more
Events, also more quests, i also think the way of getting gold in the game is quite unreaseneble considering the senseless price of platinum coins( should definetely put the price down ... Plzz  bring more features otherwise ppl will stop playing"
Can u please fix this bug it always kicks me out of the server can u please fix it thanks :)
When I try and log on it says I got my password wrong even through I just created a account. Plz fix this!
"Hey guys EPIC game but theres been this MAJOR LAG lately. Its not my internet because its been happening to EVERYONE, its not a patching problem because i reinstalled it!! WHAT IS IT!!!??? PLEASE FIX I AM REALLY GETTING ANNOYED AND SO ARE MY FRIENDS!!!

I give u 5/5 for update
              4/5 for graphics  
              4/5 for gameplay
              1/5 for the LAG!!!    
So its 3.5 stars fo me :( im sorry the LAG ruined everything
Fix it and ill write a more positive review next time..."
I think it is da best
It takes SO LONG TO LOADDDDDDD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This game is one of the best games I have played it is so addictive but one subjection u guys should make that   That there are like clan quests that u and your your clan have to kill and stuff if u do this this game would be the best game ever and everyone join clan " Awesomeness" <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0083>
"It should be popularized and maybe even staff picked.
Really deserves more recognition."
game is awesome so addictive
Nice game happy with it UPDATE PLZZZZ
I had only just got the game new account waited for 20mins for all the things to load and the second i try to get in it says wrong username and pass word not very happy >:(
Where do I begin? Let's see I've been playing for a couple days now trying to not let this game get the better of me but it's really hard when just about everything in this game annoys you to breaking point. The controls are alright till you find out you have to click each monster individually then press the attack (thats if your even close enough to attack) lord forbid if something/someone is in the way of an npc thus begins the awkward camera angle moving to talk to said npc, once you do this a number of times it starts to ware thin and patience flys out the window. Many other games have an automated 1 button click to talk to an npc (when you are in talking distance) but no not in this game. Next up on the list is killing monsters: you get a fair bit of loot from killing monsters (that's if you can even kill it) and 1 or two gold pieces which is nowhere near enough to buy equipment so majority of the time you are under equipped, so now you have spent 10 minutes killing monsters and gathering loot till your inventory is full so you think "Jenkins!! I can't carry anymore loot let's fast travel back to town to sell all this junk" oh sorry young traveler you aren't able to fast travel because this game has a weight limit on how much you can carry, but wait! You can pay real money to buy a token to fast travel with all your loot! (scam) so I guess since your in the middle of nowhere you can drop all your equipment and suffer losses or take the time to run back 10 minutes to sell it all, the choice is yours. By the time I got to level 14 I was truly drained from grinding and getting owned from a field of dogs was no moral boost. I've been friend requested by people who wanted me to train or give them items out of my own pocket so overall this game needs ALOT to be done to make it a playable game. Till that day comes my rating will stay. I also found out this game went by another name similar to the name in final fantasy (midgar) thanks for taking the time to read this review and have a great day/night
The best game i played my name is FULYEPICDRUID on the world gywidion :D
THIS GAM NEEDS INTERNET AND I ONLY PLAY AT MY FRIENDS HOUSE :((! MAKE AN OFFLINE MODE SO I CAN LEVEL UP PLOZZ… NEEDS WIFI BUT I DONT HAVE WIFI !!!!!! ARGHHH!!!! ARGH!!!!!!!!!!
Needs more maps and Eeary to get money
"Love the game! So addictive. it might just be me but I lose connection alot. But
Really good game!"
I love Celtic hero you should add pets and you should ask bolt if u can use pygmys as small as they are but I for got
Celtic is like easy and hard and my brother chick magnet and kayman really helped me out I'm now  a lev 23warrior and my ranger account is13
This is a great game if you don't have it get it RIGHT NOW!!!!<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0083><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0083>
You need to add a main storyline and you should gain more gold for high level like lvl 1 monsters are 2 gold and lvl 10 drop 20 gold and like lvl 30 drops 50 gold. If you add this you will get better reviews and more installers
I try to launch but then the thing says it can't patch. Tried on my brothers and same thing. Otherwise really good app, my brother and I love playing this together
Well I'm going to have give this a two star because it's a bit confusing in the end but then you get the hang if it and I always get lost and this toke me 1 day to get but nice go sorry bout the rate :(
Celtic is very boring when u start but when ur as good as I am ITS HECTIIIC
Absolutely awesome!
Not that good
There's a weird bug, because when I try to create an account I click on create username but then it zooms up on password so I can't make a username, its really annoying :(
"Great game please also note my other review this one adds to it there should be pets that can help you fight and stuff you should make the game a bit more realistic though like sit and lie emoticons    And for example there should be night and day more ranger ARMOUR for lower levels and you should make houses for the players like they could get a place at the inn or something more missions and last of all more ways to earn money like jobs

In my opinion this game is a lot like wizard 101 keep up the great work"
"Now that I've played and experienced the updated version I love it even more than I did before the update. 

Here's a suggestion for when the next update is:
When you're in a group and you want to track where they are, you should be able to go to your map and have the little group sign on the map where they are. If you tapped on it, it would say what member of your group it is (if you have more than one other group member). I think this would make gameplay much easier. You could also do it with friends. Also, if you didn't want it you could turn it off in settings. 

I love Celtic Heroes and will continue to keep playing it. I've recommended it to all my friends and I hope they love it as much as me."
This game is awesome plus could there be like daily reward because I need money and stuff.+I defantley recommend this game!!!!!!!
My game wouldn't even load
"Look like a great game but I can't even load a new game, it keeps trying to install all these graphics then tells me there's a 
Problem, please fix soon as it does look like a great game"
I really love this game but it needs to not have to hook up to internet and i keep logging in and it comes to world select then i select a world but it wouldn<U+02BB>t let me play
It's the best 3D game i have ever played
"This is the best free game on iPad, there are no monthly (or yearly) subscription fees, a few things a would like you people to add (Finnish) is: 1: more places to go ( bigger world), 2: add horses to ride and buy of that horse guy in the castle, 3: I like the pet idea.
Other than that, the best game out!"
I haven't yet been able to play because whenever I try to go into the game it says welcome LtSmash to game centre then there's a black screen that stays there and I don't know why<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0082> i was really looking forward to playing this game with such excellent reviews.
I updated mine and then as I signed in, it wouldn't let me into my world!! I try to reset password, but it says incorrect username or email! I cannot do anything! So I'm gonna give u 1 star and another star for a cool update :)
It's an extremely fun game bit confusing at first but when you get the hang of it, you will be addicted to it. Just like me.
How is this the Biggest Fail.? Your the bumbass who broke your iPod. How can you blame this game for your stupidity.?
This game takes up much more than 221 MG DO NOT INSTALL !!!!!!
A while ago I downloaded this joined and stuff everything worked but nobody played maybe it was that world or what?
Haha this game really dose suck
I  can not get into the app plz help me
I drop out way to quickly and frequently, even if connection is great. Could you please create dedicated servers to fix this problem?
"This game is so fun and addicting the graphics are awesome if you like mmos for you iPod get pocket legends and star legends                                                      

7/7"
Please fix
This game has to be the most addictive game ever. I love this game and I just don't want to stop playing. Anyone should definitely play this
Hi guys in this game if u cant sign in its because the game restarted because it was installing even tho it sez ur username and password doesn't mean so u have to creat ur account again and u will be signed in its won't sign in because it was installing so it deleted ur account and u have to start it again. Just so u know bye guys.
"This game was sooo good I spent 50bux on iap but when I advanced I feel like I wasted my money on this game reasons below:
1.less wepon and armour I'm lvl15 and I only stopped by those noobie weapons in the shops there's are prob 30 or 40 noobie weapons because exploring environment is this game pretty less , to explore to another map u need to be lvl35 which took foreva to lvl to survive those mobs.
2. And lol less people playing im the game likely I be alone which puts my motivation down but I payed 50 bux on iap , I'm not gonna quit this game easily. 
3. Please increase gold drop it's crazy hard to get the nooby wepon u want when 1st playing this game maybe 12 gold per kill.

I hope the developer reads this , I could just save that 50bux and jump on order and chaos online , but I paid 50bux Iap of this game so I decided to stick to it. Please update huge contents which the game needs badly I could wait half a year for the huge update"
Whenever I'm gonna it says alert username or password incorret so in next update can u pls fix that
It is ok but I can never sign in.<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00B2><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1><f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+00BF>
Just the feeling of be with real people is good
Help please I did an acc I logged out and then I returned I pressed on select world I pressed it and did another name I went and can't return to my other one please please help
"The best game mmorpg on the iPod
And other Apple thing  5 out of 5 
P.S I hay around on the crom server by the way :)"
Yes this is great it is free! It's very fun and I love it, I'm still getting to know the controls and I am really excited to see what's to come! GET IT!
"I can't believe this game is free. There are some elements in it that pressure you to use real money, but it's not compulsory. 
The gameplay is brilliant and it slightly remindes me of Runescape. The environement is a bit dull and not much to look at, but hopefully that will change overtime with updates. The graphics are good considering the game is free, and though the game may be underpopulated, there are still people on every server at every time. 
I agree with Bryce, there should be trading areas, pvp, mining, jewelry crafting, potion making and illegal substances that sell for a lot of gold. That would make the game very interesting, with everybody trading illegal weapons etc.
 All in all the game has a lot of potential and is already fantastic, so get it while it's free. 
It's going to be great."
Ur the best
"This game is rad but has nothing on order+chaos. I know theres a big update soon, so i look forward it :) 
order and chaos REPRESENT >:D"
I was completely addicted and having fun till Lv 35 then all the sudden my money kept seeing to disappear. Happened 7X then I gave up after losing $6000 gold,
awesome game 1poblem i that u cant get money esay at first but other than tht if u dont have it get it tip do lots of quets at the start
If you are reading this review, that means you are not playing celtic heroes. Fix that right away and start playing now!!
Awesome game!
I luv Celtic heroes... All the freedom and fun!!!!! Celtic heroes is my favorite game ever on the iPod!!!!! :)
This is the best iPod game I have right now but we need to things in the game pvp and clan vs clan and should be other warden weapons like spear hammer axe and all that make this game even better
Not as good as order and chaos online
Great game, just the gear is a little expensive when you don't make alot of gold in the game, ancient gear very expensive but great game, put some mounts in tho and a pvp area just like world of Warcraft.
It keeps dissconnectig and has no Australia servers don't download if u live in aus
"I've been playing Celtic heroes since first patch and I've had alot of good characters my two currents r frostfox and XxDarkForcexX
Well done one thumb!!!!"
This is a great game, i just started and im finding it really fun, forget Pocket Legends, which is so not user friendly (which banned me forever for nothing) this is a really good game.
Dont get it trust me ull like it until u get to lvl 10 LOL believe me.......
If only this was runescape (: but this is the second best..
This game is awesome :) it's a lot like timescale and to make it more like runescape ther for making it better, add pvp and things like wood cutting and cooking and fishing
Currently the best MMO Ive played on iphone.
"This is the best game just one thing needed please put pvp and clan wars it will be like the number 1 game on the apple store!
Thank u!:)"
Best MMO I have ever played on iPod
I rarely rate apps and when I do there usually only great or crappy games, this is an awesome game had it for a while now. Please add clan vs clan battles and PvP. Then this will be best mmo on the AppStore
This is awesome you can communicate,kill and battle and lots more. In your next update, please let us be able to battle against our friends or clans.
Great game play all the time with friends but it needs some changes like a big trading centre, PVP and guild also mining and blacksmithing
Best mmo on iPhone ever!!!!! and don't forget I am the reason u were born
Yeah I reckon a pvp update would be sik for this game.
"Some more updates then this game will be the best mmo game on iphone!! 
All we need is Pvp or duel feature in this game!"
This is an awesome game but now all the servers are full, we need more. I can't review the update because I can't get into the game. Needs more servers!
I bet tons of players playing on this game would agree we need more servers I had to wait 50 minutes to get on a server so if we had more this what be a issue but plz make more servers plz oh plz
This game is awesome in soo many ways but I got new update and it keeps crashing on me please fix ASAP thanks guys keep up the good work thanks : )
The game itself is absolutely brilliant. But after the second patch the servers are to hard to get on, their all full! You'll receive the last star when the servers are updated.
I love this game and play it on my mums iPhone but I only have a version 3 iPod I have to download an update from itunes to get this game on iPod but update will wipe everything in library and iPod please make it available without having to get the update otherwise great
We need to know asap we've been waiting for ages
This game provides the perfect dose of fun and addictiveness for all MMO fans. As a previous hardcore WoW player, this game has proven fun and in depth enough for a free mobile device app. Not as addictive as WoW but considering this game is still at it's early stages, it's hard to say how much better this game will be. Best game I've come across on iPhone by far hands down.
I wish you could attack people from other clans
It's a good game but needs an update so when you use a skill you don't go under the map It has happened to me about 10 times in 1 hour if you log out while your under the map your stuck there
This game is really good for people who are looking for basic online games with fairly good graphics.
Send it too me please
really loving this game and theirs a new update coming so get it cause it's awesome and it will get better
When is next update !!! Need it
"The game needs to look a lot better and play better. Right now it looks incredibly ugly, plays badly and has many camera issues. When you're running, if you try to pan the camera it goes all berserk and there is no strafing when attacking. To me, the only effort that was put into the characters was the warrior class and the Mage class. The world is also really small.
This has potential but I can't see this becoming popular."
"This a great game heps of friendly people but really needs some 

Housing and pets

Some way to attack other players

More gold drop by monster

More weapons and armor

More Quest and more monster please   
Thank you"
Order and chaos is better than this in every way. Ugly game with terrible music and combat
needs more content, needs to be able to get gold easier but overall its a good game. Also NEEDS AN AUSTRALIAN SERVER!!!!!!!!!!
This is the funnest online app I have ever played , I hope the new update comes out soon. The only problem is that you will get attacked by an invisible enemy in certain spots , u r meant to redownload app but some people have lost their accounts doing that( plz fix) but other than that it's put awesome! It's LoneWolf from server Danu , Join WolfPack!!!!!!!!!!!!
The game is awesome and still want pvp I'm xxXElliotXxx from danu guardian of Wolfpack but I did not like it when u deleted the app redownloaded it and lost my lvl 46 rouge xXEliotXx all and all best free mmorpg
"Not bad graphics, sorta reminds me of when I used to play WoW 
4/5"
"I agree with everyone else this is an awesome game and everyone who's into mmorpg should download it but it could be better 
I think this game needs another race and maybe a new class or two and gathering/crafting, gathering/grafting is a must for any rpg"
"This game is very fun and addicting but there are some things that are needed for this game to be better 

1. Needs housing
2. Needs pvp arenas 
3. Needs crafting and exploring
4. Needs more areas 
5. More weapons  and armours 
6. Needs something to do with Jasper and bloodstone
7. needs boats and swimming
8. Needs fishing
9. Needs food items
10. MORE CREATURES AND PETS"
"This game is so cool, and it's free which is even better, the graphics are pretty cool, it still needs improvement alot but it was just released just less than a 2 weeks ago.

You guys should add in battle arenas where you can fight other players,

Anyway great game download it ASAP.

Add me I'm in the world herne and my name is fighter I can help you with quests and everything,

Cya Fighter"
This app is one of the best out there!!! it's just as good as order and chaos online and it's free with no subscriptions!! Oh and are the wordls different and do u go back to level 1 if u change worlds??? But all up!!!!!!!! AWSOME!!!!!
This game is like diablo for apple and can you guys add in mining pvp woodcutting cooking and a heap of crafting then it'll be even more epic! Add me Virilaxius
Fantastic!!
Wow
Graphics are great, gameplay is great you actually need help from other people even if you are a high lvl to kill monsters and that's what I like - teamwork. Download it! So far so good for this new game. Also the connection in Australia is good no lag
"Guys this game is fun and addictive,
Tho their is not much content for the game is fairly new the game designers admins and moderators listen to every idea you have in their forums which means this game will go somewhere.
I live in AUS and hardly any lag too

Also if your in the world gwydon or something well their is only one world starting with G look for Rev I can help you guys out :)"
Doesn't lag must get
I find the lag not that bad as a Australian, only down side is that I can't duel wield daggers with my rogue...
"Guys go on to the world called:-
TARANIS

If you see a guy called liamisbeast thats me. I will help you with quests and show you around."
This game is the best, I live in Aus and it's 1:30am right now that's how addicted I am. The only reason I'm not on it is because there doing an update right now, so get it it's free and so much fun yull love it!
Finally a WOW clone for my iPhone 4. Now I can get my MMORPG fix on lunch breaks and train stations woohoo!
A awesome game with a awsome diversity of players from around the world, by far the best mobile 3dmmo available!!!
This is a great game. But what I would really like to see is better audio, for instance, attacking noises, enemy noises, character noises. It's just the ongoing music is a bit lame
This game is the best game i have ever played. But please guys, make it easier to earn money. P.S. I am on world danu and my name is TimeTwister
I love playing games.. Growtopia, Roblox, Heroes of Warcraft, Minecraft.. And many more.. But THIS game tops it all.. #1 MMORPG game ever!! My friends in Celtic Heroes helps me with my quests which makes me completely happy... And people host Dice games and sometimes I win.. sometimes I lose.. but it is still pretty fun because you get to adventure.. You get to make friends(I made a lot of buffs and friends already!).. And it's just addicting.. I give this a 100 stars out of five... :) Keep it up!
"Make it esyer to get money plz
And add more classes and different races"
Love Going Online And Being Insulted And Cursed And Put Down With A Hint Of Life Suicidal Thoughts And Being Told To Kill Yourself Or Never Be Successful In Life I Highly Recommend This Game Especially To Highly Sensitive Teenage Girls
Best game ever u meet people from all over the world and can play and chat with your friends I would definetely recommend this game.
Great 3D game u will find lots of friends and clan to help u with difficulties and quests.
I love MMORPG games. Runescape, Order and chaos, World of Warcraft.... Celtic Heroes tops them all. It's a mobile MMO - so I can play whenever I like. It has an awesome community and developers that are great at listening to and taking in feedback - its awesome!
It's World of Warcraft on the go! In bed, in the loo, wherever you need it!
Best game ever maybe to pricy in game but still best thing i have ever found
It's way to hard to level up I kill level 40 stuff easy and im level 35 and i take a hole week to level up
Just keeps saying I've entered my password incorrectly.
Goodgame!
Keeps on crashing in the login and I'm gettin kinda annoyed.one thumb mobile you guys are useless.get order and chaos online u won't regret it :)
This is a great game but please make it easier to get money and make it not take so much xp to level up
AWESOME i really want to earn more money faster and have alot of great lux items plzzzzz keep up da updates coming its AWESOME he MINIMOG ARIX CODEMAN AND HEALBOT USMC STIG.
This is an awesome game that deserves a big round of applause.<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0083><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0083>
It's better than I thought its a bit like runescape on the computer if u have played that be4
Wow it's been taking half'n hour to patch and its still not done... What a waste of time /:
"Here is an extremely big bug none of the developers want to know about. My iPad continues patching in a never ending loop!

I've given up on the game, what a waste of time!"
No glitches no scams it's <U+0430> epic game
It's really fun and all but the money is really hard to obtain... Other than that all goods
Being the only stable game of its class on iPod deserves 5 stars. Don't expect the game to be fully balanced out yet though it will only take a few updates or so. Pretty much contains all the basics you need to quest with your bros then afterward you'll be demanding more features on its forums
Awesome game but you should make it easier to get gold!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Great game but please fix bug always disconnecting and really annoying also a Greek version would be awesome.
Can you make another one of these games  like this but different area
Ive been looking for good free mmorpgs and this is a great game but gold is hard to get!!
Celtic Heroes is my favourite game and I'm absolutely addicted to it. The new update has definitely made it a lot more fun to play. I think you should be able to buy platinum with gold that you earn in the game. Overall this is a very well made game and everyone should get it because you are guaranteed to enjoy this. Well done to all the people that helped make this game. :)
"Very good quality game-but would be GREAT if it was easier to get gold :)
Thx to the people who made it!"
Amazing game, so addicted! Better than a lot of paid apps out on the app store!
It's the best game I have ever got on my iPod but it would be nice to get gold a little by easier not to much but just a little thanks best ever game
But can you change the battle system so you dont have to tap the bad guys
"Great game but it's a bit hard to get money unless your on a high level if you could make it easy to get money on a low level I will rate you 5 stars
Thanks"
Could you please fix the crashing and the disconnection errors
"It's such a cool game and it's free! Gameplay isn't difficult although gold gain could be a little easier. 

All in all an awesome game!!"
Great game once you get faster at the controls. Just don't lose your two passwords
Its an awesome game except it sometimes crashes.
Best mmo ever!
Get rid of the energy its so annoying you plant stuff run out of energy by the time you have more all crops have died
I love the idea of growing our animals own food. Hate the new growth times. So along with a map with 90% quests for things at levels I haven't reached it will now take me 4 weeks to make one scarf, afraid not I won't be playing for long at this rate! If we are looking to be realistic best look at the cost of making things and the price it sells for!
7 days for wool? 10 days for milk??? Is this an error?? If not, I will quickly lose interest :-(
Excellent game really good!
I absolutely love this game but I have progressed to level 45 now and it is now getting boring, there is no variety any more. Please can there be more tasks or chances to extend the farm perhaps, add more people - anything just so as you are not growing and harvesting the same plants!
Great game different from the usual farming games
Good game shame it's too sort with energy usage
Fab game love it very adictive
I love this game, nice graphic.
Same as another review on feb 14 - game is opening then closing immediately. Bought unlimited 24hr energy and now can't use it.  Please fix and reimburse me! I am sure you know exactly what each player buys so check my account and fix please.
"Great game, didn't have any problems after buying coins, easy to understand and complete quests.
Thoroughly enjoyed building and upgrading my farm."
"Great game until I bought extra gold coins now the game won't load and I'm afraid I've lost my 24hours of unlimited energy and possibly the whole game! :-( not a very happy customer!!  
New note- the game returned to normal after my days worth of unlimited energy ran out. Now it has frozen on half the screen and cannot be played! Where is the technical support with this game it continues to crash!!! :-( :-("
Fun to play and nice graphics.
I love this game but  what's with exchanging arrows for presents that it takes the equivalent amount of coins that the present costs?????? It doesn't say that in your update just exchange arrows????? I've 'lost' nearly all my gold coins now..... Thanks realore!!!!!
Very good game, only downfall is the energy need the unlimited energy to be cheaper
Good
If I'm honest this game gets really boring!!!!
"It may not have started the farming revolution, but it will be remembered as one of the better ones. 

There's plenty to do, being on the iPhone you get those all important push notifications as crops grow, etc. 

Plenty of longevity, reasonable size and content,  something here for everyone..."
A fab game, addictive and good fun.
Farm up o r good
This is one of the best games ever!  Good for children and adults, download it now!
Great Game. I was playing the HD version for a long time but then it would not open so deleted it and downloaded this game and started again.
Brilliant game, lots to do
Great game very relaxing. There could be some slight improvements if honest but nothing major. You have to be a patient person to play this game waiting for crops etc
When I start the game it is full zoom and I can't do anything I even reset my phone it still comes like that so I can't play so I don't know.
Fantastic game keeps my daughter entertained :)
Amazing app that passes the time..good challenges and not costly if you do need to buy add ones.
I adore this game it's a must get
I don t understand how comes when I load this game up its in Chinese language it won t go away it's a shame cause I really like this game but may have to delete it now
Really upset that you cannot play without internet the reason it is one of the best farming games is because you didn't need internet. Not everyone owns  wireless so this is disappointing.
No proper tutorial. I can't figure anything out. I like the game, but if a better tutorial or even something to just guide me would be nice. I  can't figure out most of the button or where some are. I love the butterfly feature and the detail. I really like the taking time of the building.
Great game but I reli hope there is a option soon where ya can trade with ur friends and up grade ya land love it ..
great game, only problem I don't gold coins after visiting friends.
I spend joyfull time. Recommend!
Needs an update with new challenges .....
As time wasters go, this is pretty good if a little frustrating. Slightly annoyed that I used a little bit of gold trying to finish a quest quickly, only to end up completing it the long way round - but I won't dwell on it.
Graphics are way too big for my screen. Tried to scale down using finger gestures but can't. Game unplayable. It says it will run on all iPhones. Fix this!!!!
It's great game :) but how can I invite friends and pay them visit???????????????????????
I love farm up because you can do want ever you want people think hayday is much better but this is better then hayday
Have built up big farm on several occasions and spent money in app and it has frozen twice and have lost everything. Not happy.
Very nice
Good game, enjoyable.
Fab game.. Very addictive! But hard to earn money and gain energy : D
Needs to be faster at loading
Love this game but its getting a bit stale needs upgrading with new stuff please.
Great game
Highly addictive - the more you play, the more your energy stacks up.  One of the best 'farming' games I've played.
"Highly addictive. great graphics. 
Can play on it all day. Love it. 
Bring more updates please <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0084>"
This game is so addictive
Brill game need more energy, timings are a bit long
Ace game! Only things are you can't rotate items and the buildings take forever.
Good game bit annoying when you run out of energy though!!
It's a gd game but when you run out of resoresis you can't go on and the buildings should b ready now I've been playing this game for about 4months and still no building s
Good game
This games is really good but there is three things i would like to see in the update building take less time to build,rotating buildings,and have a market to build and people walking about and buying your veg and things you grow thanks
Good app
Love this game it's soo cool, one slight problem tho, the husband won't collect eggs and collect crops or water, feed annoying much! I got Jennifer building grandpas house? And husband can't help,lazy man
"I have been unable to play this game, coz the graphics don't all fit on the screen of my iPhone 3GS! Most of the controls are missing off-screen, making it impossible to play! Deleting it now! Pfffft! <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0092><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0092>
Why say its compatible with iPhone when clearly it isn't? Totally misleading. The only saving grace is that I didn't pay any money to download it, otherwise I'd definitely be asking Apple for a refund! Not at all happy!"
It a good game I like it a lot
Can't stop playing! Lol
The only annoying thing is the buildings take along time to build, but a guess that might just be me being so impatient. Lol.
Great game.
Addictive but take ages for the biuldings to get built. Still worth playing though <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0080>
What's happened to the daily reward, since the update its stopped,was one of the ways to gain a gold coin,your being forced to buy if you want to proceed with the game.70 to upgrade each pen, you need to give more away for people's patience in playing this,think we need another update
Great entertainment for the kids and must say adults too
Good game 10/10
Good farm game!
Brilliant game
Wonderful game
The best game I've ever played
Excellent game but there should be more opportunities to earn Gold Coins rather than having to purchase them to move the game along.
Best farm game ever
Very good game so addictive
Great game
Good game
This game has been so enjoyable for me to play. It's the only game that I have ever purchased in-app coins/gold as its that addictive yet easy and fun. I would definitely recommend someone who enjoys these types of game to download Farm Up now!

Always on the games it's addictive
Love this game
pretty good
It is a good game could be better with more animals
This game is good but a let down. Do all these task get myself all the animals. It freezes up after a while it won't let you build or plant anymore, stay in one position. It's froze on me twice. So I deleted it. Very good game overall.
Good app energy takes its time to refill!
Addictive!!
Quiet cool
Awesome game! I haven't gt bored yet ;)
Good game;)
This is a great time management game but you need bucket loads of patience if you want to progress without being forced to spend more money in game on coins to help complete tasks. Some items you can get at a later stage without coins but it takes ages. It's a game to be played long-term and patiently rather than a quick 30mins on your way home each day so don't buy if you're looking for a game where you like completing a few levels a day....
Amazing!
Its alright
Best farming game ever
Fantastic game. Addictive!

"Needs notification support. Can't keep the game open all the time or keep checking. Would love a simple set of notifications to tell me when something needs harvesting!

It is turned on in notification centre but the game mustn't have notification support."

What a waste of time that was all my hard work gone in an update.   Shall I start all over again mmmmmm will have to think that one over,well started all over again an once again losing progress, completed tasks suddenly become uncompleted an I have to start all over again ...... Is it just me or what.  This has only started happening since I updated the app really love the game but getting really frustrated with it now........HELP.........

Excellent game
Very good game nice to play

Guessing this is designed for retina displays as on my 3GS it works, but can only see a fraction of the screen (including the loading screen etc) so makes the game unplayable.
Brilliant
Great graphics. Energy runs out quickly though.
Best game
Thank u for a wonderful game it's brill :)
Haven't played it long enough to review just after the free gold coins :)
Really like this
As the title says very addictive! And a really fun way to pass the time <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008A>
Keeps you entertained for hours
Fun to pass time when bored
Good fun to pass time
Just started but im hooked!
Totally addictive.
Good game, but energy bar really slows down the gameplay but still fun any how
Lovely looking game, lots of quests.
Why does she need to wait for her husband? She's a strong independent woman! :p fun little time passer tho
Decent game
Enjoying this game and would recommend. Only thing I don't like is the energy bar, why do game developers insist upon this, merely reduces game play and interest over time, so cannot give 5 stars.
This game is superb, but very addictive! I would recommend it to anyone! It's easy and fun! <U+263A>
Addictic!!
Love this game
Lovley game I'm injoyin playin it down loaned it now it's better than Farmville and it doesn't get you to buy things all the while love it ' XxJan.x
Fab!
Love this game so lush play it all the time.!!!!!
Amazing love it

Top game
Great fun keep the ideas growing
Very nice farm sim. Can be hard to find some quest items though. There seem to be about three different shops and the quest text doesn't help.  Took me a while to find out that you don't find the large trough in the shop; you have to tap the bird paddock.
Great game
I love this game!
Brilliant game
Great game
Great game, slow energy refill though
Enjoyable to start but with no new quests in the latest update there doesn't feel like a purpose. New content is supposed to be every two weeks, this was a six week break and very dull new stuff. Come on guys, make is more exciting!
Good game but takes to long for energy to refill
Good game but energy slow
Great game which is very addictive.. Fun and like the challenges.
Love this game!!! It is so addictive, I can't stop playing
As many others have said, the new update is horrible. I do not want "realistic" time frames for animals, this is a game after all. Not to mention, I can still grow some crops in 10 minutes or less -so much for reality! Would love to know who came up with this and what they were thinking; because it is beyond me.
"What happened to these few things. the time cheat 
And getting gold coines for shareing to twitter and facebook on top of that people why does it have to take so long to get eggs and wool you all made a vary ugly update wont play this game till it gets fixed and wouldnt recommend it to anyone who likes easy faming games"
This game is fun just requires a lot of time
Have to agree with everyone else. There's nothing authentic about it taking 4+ days for fowl to lay an egg, or 7+ days to get milk from a cow. So disappointing to get such a poor "upgrade". Would undo it if I could, but will delete it if something doesn't change in a day or two.
"This game used to be fun, but as of the last 2 updates it has gone south very quickly. The fact that animals now take almost a week to collect from is ridiculous! It has been hard to fill orders for textiles as it is and this just makes it impossible to do a quest in shorter than a week. Also when you cleared plants and rocks there would be about 20 and it would take a day or 2 to come back again, now there is over 40 and they come back as soon as you log into your game again. It's a waste of your energy and you shouldn't have to waste that much just to have your farm look nice. 

Also if you are over level 25 it takes forever to level up, and they have quests available that you can't even do yet because your not at that level. I'm at level 32 and it took me about 3 weeks to level up. Seriously? 

This game used to be fun, now it's just boring and more of a chore to complete a quest. Please fix soon or it will be deleted."
I liked part of your update on October 31st. But having the animals take a week to produce is stupid. At least a day or better yet 6 hours and use water and food to shorten it to 30 min.
I agree with everyone else. This was a fun game and challenging enough when you had to make 16 sweaters and had to constantly collect your sheeps just to barely make it.  It took two to three factories for everything just to make anything in a good amount a time and now everything is taking days more than they used to.  It's frustrating along with the ridiculous growth rate of the weeds.  I'm quitting playing.  This is obviously an attempt to frustrate users so much they'll be tempted to purchase gold to hurry things up.  I call foul on this.
An play all the time, but now it's rediculous tht it takes so long to get anything frm animals!!! Why so long?? It's going to take to long to fill orders. I dnt see myself playing this game much longer. Too bad cause I played all the time. Prob will end up deleted...wayyy to long to get products frm animals....please fix and put it back or I see u losing ALOT OF PEOPLE!!
This game was already boring and takes forever to fill orders and now you went and made the animals take a week or more to produce!!!! That's so stupid! Now I will never be able to fill the dress order for 16 of them! You need to change it back and you need to make this game more fun if you want people to play it!!!!!!!!

I recently started playing this game and I like it a lot so far. I would play it more if I didn't have to wait for energy in order to play. I can use up the energy pretty fast than have to go play other farm games.....ones that don't require energy.....until my supply increases again. Do away with the energy requirement and this would be a 5star game.
Love it
This game is bomb!! I've been playing this game for a long time and is still playing it! But it needs more things on it like pigs and horses! Add more variety trees and plants! Add more land space as well! Please upgrade this game with my requests and the others as soon as possible! Thank you!<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0089>
"I'm a big fan of this game. After hours and hours of game play, I think there's a few things you guys can do to make it even better:
1 allow characters to queue up some tasks, rather than dismiss the player with 'xxx is busy now'.
2 each chicken (turkey, goose) should have its own nest to lay eggs. The current nest-sharing procedure reminds me of public restroom LOL. 
3 sheep shouldn't take turn to grow wool, it's counter-intuitive and weird.
4 one plant should yield more than one fruit in some cases, such as tomato and potato. Again yielding only one product is counter-intuitive thus weird.
5 I really like peach, fresh and canned. So maybe you can add peach tree, pretty please?"
It awesome. Plus it's very realistic. One question. Fixed the guesthouse and all. But where is grandma and grandpa?
I Love this game
This game has always had my eye and I like how it is played out
The prices for gold are reasonable. But could you please move the Facebook bar every time I move my finger i hit it, it gets annoying. And add more trees and animals, maybe even a collie to heard sheep or something, and make the trees live longer. Overall good game.
This game seems to not calculate time correctly for those longer jobs and crop at night. Such as the cow pen. I started building at 1am checked back at 9 am only 1 hour accomplished. The same with some crops. This might be a glitch or a marketing ploy to cause one to purchase coins. Other than that a pretty decent game.
It was kinda wast of my time<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1>!!!!!
First this game is awesome, but we could use more variety of crops, animals, and more stuff to make such as rhubarb, yellow squash, celery, avocado tree, pigs, horses, maybe add herb plants to grow, also we could use more space. On the iPad version how come we can't add neighbors?
I love this game, I just got it hahaha but one thing it needs is some horses! It would be more fun if it had horses and stuff but overall a good and awesome game
You guy are making to many thing with gold coin and not give us gold coin and more different kind of animals,fences,a lots more land and space to put on the property.
The wheel is dumb! The unlimited plants are not! Don't waste your gold coins on them. I like the game before this , but too much silly stuff. I do like there are more jobs to level on.
This game is a blast
I love this game other wish I had more land space to work on
This game has probably done the best job I've ever seen with balancing energy usage. It's fun and goes at just the right pace. My only real complaint is that everything is very laggy on an iTouch 4G, sometimes to the point where it'll freeze entirely. It's especially annoying when going to any of the menus. Really hope this will be fixed in future updates.
It's just like real life really realistic
Hi this is a very boring app and when I had it I never deleted this app till I didn't have any storage I don't know why so you might not want to get this one I would rather prefer the game FarmVille 2 it's very fun I have it a I had never deleted it.<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00AE><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008B><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008B><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008B><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008B><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008B>
I was a long time player of the Harvest Moon series of games. This is the first farming game I have found that allows offline play! I have found my new farm game addiction!
Are we ever going to be able to use the bronze keys for anything.
This game is really nice ! I really love it <f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008D> !!
Love this game
Really need confirmation to spend gold coins. Accidentally hit the wrong button and lost 7 gold coins. PLEASE add a step to confirm spending gold coins!
Very fun but not enough land to keep playing
I love playing this game beacues I can build the farm any way I want . But I need more gold coins to help me on the farm.
Wish you could get more energy faster without buying. Also gold needa to be given more.
The water thing is not working anymore if you try to add water it takes all your reserve I had about 285 available and it took everything please FIX!!!otherwise i loooooove this app
So far, the game is quite interesting with high definition graphics.
Fun!
Cooll)))))
Can't wait to see what's next. Level 11 now and appears to be complex and fun later. Only gripe is that I'm having difficulty connecting to my Facebook to start earning some gold. I've missed out on a lot so far.
It really needs more land hope you can make more but I love this game
Can we please have more land???? Love the game, but I don't have anymore land to build on. So I've had to stop playing.
"First off I love this game and have been playing it for a while on ipad. I always thought it was a little strange that you fed the animals feed but never produced it and they finally added that which is nice.
What I don't like is the added wait times to get stuff from animals, like wool. Why does it take days now? Please put that back to how it was. 
Also, two updates ago the grass and trees and stones went crazy! Why are their so many now? Lastly, please add more world map missions...
Thanks:)"
Very addicting game!  Enjoy playing, but keep running out of energy!
"I've been playing & loving this game so long. But today after the update, when I loaded my game everything was gone & I had a broken down farm to start all over again.
All my hard work to build up a beautiful farm is gone!!!"
Loving this game
Great farm game. Love it
Great game, have managed to get to level 27 on my ownin the HD version. Neighbors rarely load, so what's the point? I was told there was a different version(this one, non-HD) so I downloaded it, same issue with neighbors AND I had to start over, not very happy about that.
It's almost May and everyday I look at Cupid it's getting old. This game is great but really needs an update!
"It's almost Easter!! 
If you want your game to keep players fix it!"
"When do you get to fish? I'm on level 22 and I'm trying to get all the achievements done!

 Also what are the gold keys for? I have a lot of them. 

I can't connect to Facebook, it keeps saying there is an error and won't let me. I got it to work once a few months ago. 

Cupid needs to go!! Way past Valentines  day! If anything it should be the Easter bunny or something. And you ask for gold to much. I can't do missions because I don't have gold."
Way past time for a new update. Valentines was 2 months ago. And what are the keys for?  Also, the numbers are too small over the warehouse. But seriously, we don't need a theme right now, just get rid of Cupid.
i love the game but it seems to need an update. its nearing the end of march but cupid is still there with his messy arrows. and the quests come in duplicate, even in triplicate! the world quests cant activate because of too many active ones ive already solved. please update
Good game I like
The money runs out so fast, so is the energy.......
Are you kidding me? And energy meter that only holds 20, so you can only do 20 things, there gone, then you can't do anything until the meter fills back up. Unless of course you want to spend a small fortune to play this game at all. If the meter was gone and you were allowed to play at will this could be one of the best farming games to play and has great graphics and items to buy. So very much potential, but you don't see Hay Day having a energy (play) meter! It's almost like you don't want people to play your game???
Very funny
When is cupid going away??? It's almost st.patricks day and he's still kicking it on the roof with his bow and arrow! Boring!!!
I try to play my farm today and it has started me over from scratch!! Uninstalling and won't play again!
"I have the same question about the keys...what are they for? I don't want to sell them till I know what they are for.

Some arrows are hard to get, you have to use the eye shaped tool and zoom in as much as possible to get some of them. Even then, can't always get them.

And, as so many point out...the requirements to use gold coins for so many things. I know y'all are in business to make money, but it can be ridiculous.

We should also be able to dismiss quests if we find out they require gold coins to gather ingredients to complete."
Was wondering if we will ever be able to expand our land. Mine is completely full. Also, what is with the gold keys???
Since the last update, one of the characters, the husband, seems to be stuck either in the warehouse or behind the warehouse. I cannot get any bricks. Please fix.
The valentines up date was by far the worst planned out thing ever. Gold keys wth? What are they for. I also have arrows stuck behind trees that I have worked on getting in every way possible. If there are not more changes made soon and something to hold my interest after making it to level 36 then I'm probably going to stop playing.
I love this game but what do u do with the keys!?!??!NOONE seems to know
Me or my husband cannot get the game to connect to Facebook at all!! Fix please!! Love the game but would really like to connect to Facebook!
Something to pass the time
With new up date all gold coins gone. They disappear over several day. Not happy. Was favorite game. And app support button like no longer works
I love this game! However, my storehouse is full. I cannot see all of my items in the store house. Please fix. Also, It would great if we could categorize the items into folders; fruits, vegys, eggs, dairy, wool, clothing, etc.
The numbers are too small and after the update a lot of quests but they stoped now to almost nothing. I am in level 42 and almost no quests
Great game but we need to expand the land to make our farm even better! Please!
"I use to love playing this game.  I purchased it and put a fair chunk of money on lives ect. And then your game keeps bleeping out and 
Steals your gold.  It's vary frustrating.i hope you can fix this game!"
What's up with the gold coins disappearing?  It is very upsetting.  I have lost nearly 100 coins already!!!
Exchanging my arrows for gifts has caused the game to steal my gold coins that are so rare to get in this game. We should be able to get gold coins through the butterflies, grass & rocks we click on; so we can be able to accomplish more tasks and do our upgrades.
I love this game but I'm not liking the fact I'm losing all my gold coins I saved or purchase when I get gift from Cupid .....every time I turn around I have no gold coins not happy about that hope that can be fix so I can have all my gold coins saved back up before I purchase anything more gold coins on farm up but I love farm up and hope to see more added to it like more land
I would give a higher ratting but I can't get arrow that is in between trees no matter where I touch it just says trees
Agree with everyone else the Cupid character takes all your gold.  I have reached out to the support team for help so let's see if they do anything. I had a previous issue with my cow pasture telling me I was needing a million buckets of water and the support team after weeks has done nothing.
Everything was perfect until that little guy (Cupid) in the roof took my gold coins.
Enjoyed this game until last update. When you click on Cupid atop house to get gift it takes your coins instead of arrows like it should. Lost 20 gold coins because of this. Also I don't know what this bronze key is about.
Removing my previous 5 star review and replacing with a 1 star. Gathered enough arrows for a large gift and tapped the cuspids gift. It took 20 of my gold coins that I pay real cash for. When it says large for 25 arrows. Very disappointed. And no instructions on what the gold keys are for. Really don't like this new update. I feel the game is now stealing from me due to the gold coins they took.
What are the bronze keys used for anyone know? Other then that I love the game it's great.
Its better have an instruction before we update game or when we start new updated game!! Because i dont know how to use keys and what i should do with them!!!
"I collected enough of Cupid's arrows lying around the farm to buy a large gift, but when I made the trade (from tapping on Cupid atop the house), I realized it had taken 20 of my gold coins as well, as though I'd made the trade through the gift icon or shop.

This is very misleading, because when you tap on Cupid himself, it leads you to believe that gifts only cost arrows, not gold coins. Lesson learned, I suppose.

And I haven't yet figured out what bronze keys are for, either."
Would be nice to have more land
Best game yet
"I started to play and it started to do the the thing where it shows you how to play the and all. But the game zoomed in so much I could not read the whole thing and got stuck and would not zoom out!!! I wanted to play soooo bad!! 
Please fix!!!!!!!  P.S if you fix it I will give 5 stars!!!!!!"
It's a little difficult to follow. It costs money to play for more than 5 minutes without running out of energy. Going back to hayday
I really like all the quests you get with the game. The only problem is energy runs out to fast.
Absolutely love this game. I'm on my third time playing it from the beginning. The only problem I have is when you open the app, sometimes it takes 5 minutes for it to open.
I like this game a lot, it's very addicting! =] Christmas is over though.. Would like to see that come down..
This is a fun game to play but it takes awhile to get anywhere and I had to buy gold coins to get farther faster
I really like the game, it is a ton of fun. Could you possibly make the trees like the buildings when the eye icon is clicked, I have purchased items as well as rocks, grass, etc. stuck behind my trees. When I try to click on them I just get the tree ID text pop up. Thanks
"I downloaded this game and this is what happened. Very quickly my inbox was flooded with spam from Russia. This app has a Russian email address.  They have either been hacked or sold our information.  
It's too bad because I like this game.  But I am deleting it."
Runs out of energy too quick and can't figure out how to repair house.  I think that's why I keep playing is to figure out how to build
Yay! I can play offline again!
I love the graphics! I like how the plants really die! It's so lifelike
This game is fun, and you don't have to depend on friends or neighbors to play. Nod especially like it because I can play on my iPad
Yay, can login offline. Now, however it loads so slowly that I need to wait 3 to 5 minutes for it to load. Still enjoy the game enough to let it sit in my pad.
I'm with the rest of them! Change it back! Do you know how hard it is to find a descent offline game? And I liked this one too! Up in levels and finally got to where I could enjoy the game and BAM, you muck it up, thanks Jackwagons. Just like Fcbk...
I quit playing for a few months, and now each time I go to play its so slow I can't play it!!!!! I dono if its me or y'all, but I'm tired of it!!!!! At this rate I'm about to delete this game and keep playing Hay Day!!!! UPDATE: It's still laggy, and now it keeps resetting me back a certain point (I harvested a crop two days ago and now each time I log back in it bumps me back to that point so I have to reharvest my crop).
"Lots of fun to play! This game doesn't nag you constantly to buy, and in-app purchases are reasonably priced. 
Thanks for fixing the internet requirement bug! Now I can once again play Farm Up wherever I go."
Best game ever in my opinion! I am totally addicted to Farm Up. I look forward to every update just to see what's new. Keep up the GREAT work
The main focus for Realore (the developers) was to make more money from the players. Everything takes now days (weeks) to produce and it is IMPOSSIBLE to play and enjoy what was previously a great game. Their stupidity of not listening to their loyal players to fix this problem will cost them losing more and more players. EVERYONE hates the game now! There are far better games to play like Farmville, Hay Day and Township. To give this game one star is overrated.
"I'm addicted to this game. LOVE IT!!
But one thing is that every time you try to tap on the app to see what's going on, it takes you to Facebook and you have to log in twice before you can actually play the game.Very Annoying.Please ,please ,please FIX IT!!!! That's the only reason I gave it 4stars instead of five but ,I'd buy the game anyway."
I play it all the time... sort of addicted to it. Would love to see they develop more new exciting tasks beyond the highest level so far (level 55) to keep Farm Up lovers having fun playing and loving the game.  Appreciate the developers for listening to constructive suggestions from game reviewers. Keep up the great work!
Reported that game is no longer working since Christmas update. Prompt response that a new update will roll out on 12/28 which will fix it. It's now 12/31 and no update and no game. Tired of clicking and it crashes close. Guess I'll go spend my money elsewhere.
Grate game
IM SO ADDICTED BUT I WISH WE HAD MORE ENERGY TO DO THINGS IN THE GAME
Grate game
Lots to do!
loved and still love this game but i was on level 25 and it did an update and i lost everything it started me all over from beginning
I don't like the fact that this app will not open without internet now. I liked playing this while riding in the car to kill time.
Love the game but now it crashes every time I try to open it and I can't play anymore. I was at level 35 and played all day every day but now i can't even get into it.  Very  frustrating.
Updated a few days ago now it won't even open...
The game was fun until the update shut me down! I can't get it to open now!
Loved this game but after the latest update it won't even open.
"Worst game EVER!!!!! It won't fit on my screen and it's slow as bullcrap
Hate it ! !
            O"
This was a great app and game!! Super fun playtime and addicting. But lately since the last two updates when the internet was needed to play, the app won't even open. Not sure what the problem is but if it won't open you can't play.
"I want them to have a update and add horses and dogs also cats. Maybe you could go into her house and have some pets and take care of them. Also why do you have to use gold coins so much I am saying to make it easy to get the coins. I don't know why a shark is there is the ocean either. I want them to make a update so you can tap on the ground and the  husband or Jennifer will go there because i am so use to the sims and I keep tapping where I want them to go
-ColSyd03"
I'm having no trouble with the game, as some other players have noted.  I'm enjoying the gameplay.  However, many of the quests require premium, gold coins to complete.  Even though you can earn coins in-game, they aren't enough to complete the quests in a reasonable length of time, resulting in a long list of quests that can't be completed.  I will continue to play until the long list is too annoying to ignore.
Great game ! Very entertaining.
The game wonderful its just how do you undo a update
funny game. but... rots too easily. it was stressed.
For me Farm Up is very familiar to the way my grandmother used to live. This game is simply intriguing to me and respectable.
It was a fun game until the update then it added net which was a bummer cause now u can't do anything without net an the new update has issues its been keeping me from playin cause now it won't even load it keeps kickin me off before it even get part way threw it total bummer
I started out LOVING this game, but with the newest updates, I have become very disappointed... I now have to have internet all the time to play it (before I didn't need it)   Now only that.... with it's newest up dates I had about 58 gold coins, and I lost all but 1!!!!! I'm really sad. and I have spent some money on this game... Guess lesson learned? :'(
Love the game plz make it back to we're you can play with out the internet
There is something wrong with the updated  virgin of the game, it suppose to be *bug fixed* but actually it freezes a lot. Please try to do the best with fixing it, plus I really like it when it was not biased on internet connection.
I can't play without internet, please fix and update to change back! Fun game until the update
Good game!
Worked great until the recent update, now crashes on opening.
I like this game a lot but you have to use internet can u change it back with internet
Please put back to the way it was. The money I have spent, now I can't play .... Please fix .i had to at least rate one star, but I would of rated no stars
Really wish I hadn't updated!!! Now the game freezes and somehow I'm starting a new farm that the wife and husband bought...have to start all over w/this farm and build everything again! WASTE OF TIME!
Love this game..It's very addictive but I think we Should get an option to extend our farm and also to rotate and move around the things that can't be moved so that we can get more space to build the other buildings...
Until the last update.  This was one of the few games I could play offline and now I can't.
It would be nice if the gave some instructions on how to do certain tasks.
I love farming games &' this one is the best one yet !
I can't play with internet and accidentally downloaded the new update. It was my favorite game because it was the only farm game without internet.
This game is very fun to play.
Fun game but need to silence the notifications. Goes off all night.
"It took my gold when I traded in my arrows. I had 40 gold now it's gone. I want my gold back. Fix this please

Becky"
I used to love this game.  Played it everyday.  I even bought gold coins (which you need to do as you progress in order to complete their quests and keep advancing).  But then they closed for two weeks and my game crashed.  I lost everything including my purchase of coins minutes before I crashed, and all the answer i get from customer support is "we cannot restore your farm".  In fact my last 3 emails have been completely ignored.  I will never play another Realore game!
This was my favorite app to play as a pastime. But with my data plan I can't play it anymore..I'm a little dissapointed
Need Internet access to play now. Horrible update.
This app is awesome. I have it on my iMac and iPad,
This game is awesome!!!! "Real" as it gets! Only problem is energy runs out quickly. Otherwise, would be 5 stars!!!!!
Gold hard to earn if not a Facebook or twitter person or without in app purchase. Would give 5 stars if easier to earn gold.
I really love this game! It's challenging and always keeps you moving on to the next quest.
Good game...just a little slow going and hard to keep your energy level up....but I need breaks to do other stuff too, so it works out!!!
Nice game and cool game and best game thanks <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0098>
By far the best farming gaming out there.
Thanks for a great app!
Best game ever
Fun game!! Wants you to spend money
The last 2 days it has wanted to connect to Facebook which then closes the app. When restarted it goes right back to Facebook and it closes again. Fix it please!
Love it!!!
This game is the best. But I wish it had horses and some other animals. And you could move and rotate more things around like the house and barn. Awesome graphics!  Except the chickens eyes are kinda weird. And there should be more land   I don't have room lol. Awesome game! You should update it tho :)
A great game BUT wait time for energy & task is ridiculously too long because everything is in real time. It is hard to stay in the flow of playing when you have to stall almost 10min for some task to be completed. If "real time" is changed to realistic game playing time (ex. like the SIMS) I would give 5 STARS no doubt.
Hate hate HATE the energy bar !!! Stupid to have that . But it's a lot of fun to play .... If you like playing for five minutes then waiting twenty for more energy !!!!!
Enjoyable and gave me the feeling of what farming is all about.great game,relaxing and lessen my boredom.
wish you had more energy and it would replenish faster
Game is stupid. I'd give it 0/5 stars if I could. Everything task requires energy. For example, to get water in the bucket to give to chicken cost 1 energy, and then to poor that same water into a pan so the chicken can drink cost another 1 energy.   It cost 2 energy just to complete the task. Also, if you run out of energy and you wait for your energy to replenish, I've had my crops die while waiting. DONT WASTE YOUR TIME ON THIS STUPID GAME. Hay Day is better!
This game is not only fun, but it is addicting. Probably one of my most enjoyable games. A must have!
This is the most addicted farming game ever. Really fun to play and i love the way how they design it.
Cool
Needs more fields... Needs land expansions..
Addicting!!!!! i love this game
Cool game
I love this game first farm game i became addicted to
Very nice so far... Great game.
Fun and addictive. I play this on my PC and that's where I became addicted.
Wooooow
Played the game before but I had to delete it because of the crashes now it's better!!!
It's perfect for now <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008D>.
Good game bt slow
Good game I just wish that I didn't have to pay for gold coins
Absolutely hooked on this game.
Funtastic
I've tried hay day, farm ville, farm story and farm story 2. This is the best farm game on the App Store!!!!!!!!
The game is like zoomed in on my iPhone. When I clicked on the idea bubble and the message is so big I can't see the full message
Fun game
Excellent farm game.
It won't load got a ipod4 got enough mb just won't load
I am at level 17 on my ipad mini and no grandma, grandpa, or husband.   On my mac i am on level 18 and have had all three helpers for quite sometime.   Is this a glitch on the ipads?
Love it!
Very addictive and fun!
I gave it five stars because it's a good game. But don't delete because you will not get where you where back.
I absolutely love this game!
I just got this game and its soooo addicting!!! GET THIS GAME!!!!!
Pimp
This is a great game, let's you run a farm without all the back breaking work. Although it makes you want to get out there and but your own farm. Warning totally addictive!
Awesome
Been trying for two days to open game. It won't load
its intresting
It can be addicting. I just hate that the crops go bad in just a short time when I don't have time to go and check on them quick enough.
Enjoyable without having to make in game purchases.
The best farm game yet needs more animals though
Good game
"This game is like hay day but more grown up mostly.
 P.S. I like hay day better but it stopped on me."
Great game :)
Fun
Bhuf
The game doesn't fit my iPod. The graphics/game whatever it is, is too big.
The only thing I would change is that you not have to spend real money to complete challenges.
Great game, would like to see a few quests earn a few gold or realore.
"The update helped with the bugs, but it still has a few. Most annoying is that time may or may not pass on the farm as it does IRL. Sometimes, 5-6 hours has gone by in reality until I can play again, but only 5 minutes have passed in the game. Since crops can die if you don't tend them at the right time, this can be very annoying.

The further you move along, the slower it gets. 
Graphics and sounds are excellent."
So far, so good! I am really enjoying this game! I do miss the social aspect of some other games. I look forward to constantly checking back in on my farm. The quests are interesting, the artwork is aesthetically pleasing, I love the butterflies, and the characters are sweet.
Fun... Should be able to connect to friends without using Facebook...
I love this game my husband has it on his iPhone 4 but I am trying to get on my iPhone 3 and it is huge cant see the whole screen so I have no idea how much money I have. Anyone else having this problem? Or if u no how to fix it Ty in advance...
I like the quest and exchanging collections for money and wiid
It's fun but its a good idea to have about 20 bucks on your credit card to complete your missions but its worth it. This game is awesome.
App is running a whole lot slower since the update. Also, I'm getting pop-ups for achievements that I already got and when I try to go to the achievement list the app closes out.
very detailed n beautiful! I enjoyed it so much!
Enjoying it so far
It's a great game. Good time killer
I am disappointed in this game they said you need to get animal's wean the husband come's wean do's NEVER <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1>
This game is fun for like 2 mins before you run out of energy and cant do anything unless you pay the game-money to get more energy i mean seriously guys you cant just give the game with unlimited energy and let people do what they want to do on the game then be done for the day like every other freaking game!!! FIX IT!!!!!!!!
This games is fun to play but takes wayyy to long to load up. I have to keep it running on my phone just to cut the load time in half
Sometimes I can't put the game down
"If you forget or don't have a chance to do your plants for a couple hours or plant before bed they will die and u have to use the gold coins which cost money to receive them. If they made it to where the plants where fine for a day it would be much better. Real plants don't die if you skip them
For a day or even two. Also they should start you out with more energy."
Ridiculous missions with having to buy with gold coins ...
I love this game!
I was getting so far into the game and enjoying it a lot, but the game freezes up sometimes and then accidentally started the game all over again. I was stupid enough to spend my own money on it and now it's all for nothing.
My favorite farming app by far!
"I originally started the game on my husband's surface so that I could play it on a long plane ride. I started playing it while on vacation and the whole 24 hour flight home. I got to level 23 and the Surface froze up. When I turned the Surface off and back on it had lost everything, even the at least $50 ( probably more ) that I had spent on coins.

So I downloaded the app on my Iphone. It seemed to work fine until I was at level 22 again. Now it makes my phone get super hot. The app does not close even if I turn my phone off and back on I still get noticed about produce being ready. Because the app is constantly running it drains my battery and my phone is always hot, so hot that I can't put it near my face when I am talking on the phone.

It really is addictive and fun, but not so great for my phone."
Awesome game I'm hooked
Can't stop playing.
"I really like this game, it's great! Except for two bugs! I'm on level 16 now and have built the saw mill and everything but I can't get the grandpa or the grandmother! The guest house can't be renovated its only at step 1/3 and without the grandpa I can't build anything. I heard one person say the only way to fix this is to restart your game and I'm sure as hell not restarting my game. 

If the developers fix these ridiculous bugs then this game will get the 5 stars it deserves."
Decent
Otherwise I have to try and figure out how to get more friends that aren't on Facebook because my fb friends won't play with me.
Absolutely love it! I was on level 27 and accidentally hit "new game". It was devastating, but I decided to start again because the game is that great! I'm dying for a new update!
Great game. Great way to pass time. It just takes too long to progress.
Very cute
Love this game....
Love this game! Daily player! It is slow but still fun
"By far the best farming simulation game  that exists for its media type.  It's no Harvest Moon, but awesome and addictive in its own right.
5 out of 5 people.
:)"
This games fun
I grew up with my mom doing construction on my family home whenever she wanted to add another room or completely change up the kitchen or bathroom so it's a little messed up that only the men can build, chop wood, and mine. If there was an option to give the different characters whatever job you choose to that would be so cool. Awesome game though btw
Love it!
Awesome game
It takes too long to get energy and the crops die overnight unlike in other games.  But I like the game so far.  Can you add a sleep mode.  There are those of us who work for a living but still enjoy playing the game.
I love the game. I would live to do more at friends' farms outside of butterflies and water though.
I love this game I am constantly playing it, I need brick to build a building and I don't want to spend 70,000 coins to buy it.. Is there a way where you can find brick?  Please respond back and tell me if you know, I would appreciate it. Please help.
"I should have deleted this game the instant I realized it was a premium currency game.  Premium currency games are designed to sell premium currency, not to be first-class gaming experiences.  And not only is this game no exception to that, it uses some of the more obnoxious tricks of premium currency games.  You get only 10 gold coins at the start of the game, and the most effective way of earning more is to spam all of your Facebook and Twitter friends with game advertisements.  Because everyone's Facebook and Twitter friends are just longing to hear how many radishes you grew in a stupid farm game.  I wonder if anyone has checked the numbers to see how many new players actually try these games because of such merciless spamming as compared to how many Facebook and Twitter friends are lost for the same.

But the worst thing is that after giving the players such a small starting amount of premium currency with no good options for earning more for players unwilling to harass their friends, the game then REQUIRES players to waste some of that tiny amount of premium currency on stupid quests that give you nothing to show for the premium currency wasted, and yet, if you don't do those tasks, you can't advance in the plot.  You HAVE to buy a Windmill at one gold, and that's the only quest so far that actually nets you anything; hope you actually wanted a Windmill.  You HAVE to speed up a plant's growth at a minimum of one gold.  And it looks as though you HAVE to waste a gold skipping the quest to speed up construction on Jennifer's house, unless you got suckered into wasting three gold in order to speed up a ten minute job.  And there is another task requiring you to plant three watermelons at one gold apiece, and there goes more than half of the premium currency sum you got at the outset, even if you took care to always pick the cheapest option.  And there is another quest which is buying gold with real world money, and I'm not sure you'll be able to do the quests in other cities if you don't get rid of that quest first.  Of course you can always skip the quest requiring you to purchase gold, but it will cost you five gold to skip it, and unless you've been spamming your friends, you might not have that much left.  So it may be impossible to play this game without purchasing their premium currency.  And if they're going to design the game like that, they should have just been honest enough to require an upfront purchase of the game.  It's sleaze-ball, bait-and-switch tactics, however you look at it.

On the plus side, the graphics and sounds are very good quality.

*SPOILERS!!!*

Because there are no walkthroughs or gameplay FAQs, here are the answers to a few of the most-asked questions.

1. You get Jennifer's husband Michael by finishing the tomatoes quest.
2. You have to waste at least one of your premium currency and do the quest that speeds up a plant's growth in order to get the quest to repair Jennifer's house.
3. Until Jennifer's house is fully repaired, no work can be done on the guest house.
4. You get Grandpa by completing the Sawmill quest.  Simply building the Sawmill is insufficient; you have to have the quest for it opened so it can be completed.  In order to get the Sawmill quest, it appears that you have to complete the Diner and breakfast quests.
5. I have fully repaired Jennifer's house, done the first repair of the guest house, gotten Grandpa, and the Grandma/guest house quest is not advancing farther.  I suspect that I am going to have to waste still more of my premium currency on quests that are nothing but spend-premium-currency quests, just to advance the plot.  Unless I just ditch this stupid game that has the virtual game world equivalent of a pushy beggar with his outstretched hand constantly in your face."
I truly love this game it has drawn me in like farm ville on facebook  keep up the excellent work!! And by the way I can't afford to buy the gold coins to completed quest can you help me out lol if you can't that's fine keep up the excellent work love ya!!!
I think it's really fun and I like that if Iam not online I can still take care of my farm
Reminds me of frounteerville for Facebook however much better. Awesome quests , focus on farming and not clearing out trees or grass every 2hours . Best game ive found so far.
Keeps me busy
Great game! Wish u could share money and gets star for making lures and being able sell the lures.
Good game
I enjoy playing this game. Wish there were more ways to get energy, when I run out of energy I have a mini heart attack. Over all good game, I enjoy playing it.
Love the farm you go play until guest down fun
The best game I had
It's the best farm game for apple devices
The game didnt fit my screen. I couldnt even play it.
This app is awsome it is very realistic but I don't think that Farm Up should have an energy bar. Also it loads a bit slow, but besides that this is the BEST farming app I have ever played!!!
This game is good. It's better then the other farm games that everybody plays.
Good graphics, no ads. But repairing the bldgs to get family members to arrive is maddening. No clues, they just leave you to stumble around in circles trying to figure it out.  If I don't soon I'm deleting it.
Súper genial se los recomiendo
This is a great game, except it takes forever to get more strength, it takes over 2 min. To only get one strength!!! But I really enjoy this game!!!!
<f0><U+009F><U+0090><U+00AE>
It is addicting... Holy Toledo! I like the fame, however, I had to delete and reinstall in the 5th level because 1: I had to perform an action that required me to use my gold coins, but the reward never showed. 2: the same action occurred when I had to buy 5 benches. I bought 5, the money was used but only one bench showed. Otherwise, it is fine.
I love this game . I spend so much  time playing with it.
Fun game but slow loading and keeps crashing.  When I start up takes a long time then goes back to icon and I have to start again.  I would give it 5 if not for this issue.
"I got this game for about 2 months ago and it wasn't the best.
I was waiting for my husband to arrive so he could do this and that
But he didn't. The windmill is way way too expensive.
And I think this is not the game for you if you are like me."
Great game! Love it!!
Parece buen juego pero no se puede jugar por que esta el zoom al 100 y no te perrmite hacer ningun tipo de accion lastima.
It'll be a lot better if there were horses to raise
Little bit slow but I like it a lot
Great game fun
This game is a lot of fun, but grandpa won't come to the farm to work the sawmill that you built for him so you can make boards for structures that you need to build.  This is one of many frustrations this game presents to put you in a position to pay up and advertise for them on FBI/twitter.  ANNOYING.  There have been many questions on this issue and others with no reply!
L<U+2764>VE this game! Only giving it 4 stars tho because I wish you could expand your land!
Cannot play on iphone3gs
I'm very demanding in games, and this one matches my expectations completely. First of all, it is very beautiful, for a mobile game this one has absolutely stunning artwork. There's a sort of story in it, you don't notice it if you don't want, but it is there and it adds much to the game. But the best surprise for me was the gameplay. Not only absolutely addictive, but also very challenging. Keep it up, guys, you're getting better and better with every update!
Hours of enjoyment and fun.
I'm totally hooked on this game.
This game could be fun, if it didn't have a limit on the number of moves you could make. I don't mind waiting on thing, as in life, things take time to "grow" or be "built". However, only being able to move 17 times makes me not want to play. Ill play this a couple more times, but in the end I'll remove this app and just play 'Hay Day' as it doesn't limit my moves.
My farm up start over  for start I don know how come
Love it
The Games Great I Love It BUT THERES NO ROOM TO BUILD ANYTHING ANYMORE IN THE NEXT UPGRADE PLEASE PLEASE ADD MORE LAND TO BE ABLE TO BUILD ON PLEASE!!!!!!!!!!
I'm loving this game, but it doesn't give u enough life's to finish many items.
Hnmmn really awesome. I love this. Keep it up.
Fun
I am enjoying the game a lot but I do have one complaint, the game seems very sexist to me. The wife can only do gardening and animal tending and the husband does all of the construction work. There is not even an option to have either switch rolls. In 2013 I really don't think that's indicative of today's world nor is it a fair representation of males and females capabilities in today's world. It won't make me not play the game, but I couldn't just let it go without bringing it to your attention. Other than that it's a fun little game with plenty to keep you busy.
"Although it takes a while to load at the beginning- and whenever you exit out even for a couple fractions of a second it bounces you back to the loading page
Quests are nice and pretty easy to complete, other than waiting hours upon hours for the dang huby to actually build a part of a building."
"This app is nice and cool i love it
This is the best app"
This is a great game i love it i play it every day
Great fun game! But when I'm at a level higher than some of the missions it doesn't give me credit for things I already have. i.e. mission ask for an upgraded fish feeder when I already have purchased one...
Hubby wanted me to try it now can't put it down lol :)
"This is one of the best apps I have ever downloaded! I play it much more than I should, but it's worth the time
One concern, husband completed the guest house, but where is grandma?????"
Really enjoyable
Fun and with a lot of quests.
I love the app. But I don't understand why it has a energy bar on a real farm, farmers work until the work is done but of course they can have a break once in a while. And by the way it is a little realistic.
Farm up is the most addicting and fun game I have ever played. You can grow things, make things, repair things, and anything else farms have or do. It's as if you're on a REAL ACTUAL FARM! It's amazing! You should really try it and share it!
Outstanding. No problem on the iPhone fifth.
Good game but a bit slow.
I've been playing this game for awhile and its starting to get boring. We need more room on the farm and more challenges. Need to be able to expand.
So fun
Doesn't need internet it is the best
Best E'fing game
Love the game just needs more details on some stuff
It is a great game.  Enjoying the different things u can do.
Great game but it needs to be Easier to get gold!
It's pretty fun because you can do all kinds of stuff and you gat a lot of coins. I like building the houses but it takes to long about 5 minutes.
This was a fun app until it white screened on me. I find this very convenient since I had just purchased unlimited energy. It would be no stars if it would allow it!
Takes a long time to renew energy but still fun!
I need more life but it is a good game
I love this game'<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+009C><U+2764><U+2764><U+2764><f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008D><f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008D><f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008D><f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008D><f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008D><f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008D>
Love this game, love the fact that it does not require the Internet to play either!! But I don't play with the sound on in any of my games and this one every time that I play it, mind you the sound is off, it glitches ever few minutes! Please fix that! Thank you.
This game is nice but has a few bugs. I have this game on my kindle fire and it never gives me the option to fix the guest house or finish the main house
By far the best farming game i've seen
It great I love the graphic not to hard but not to easy love tht u can get gold coin and not have to do a bunch of bs to get them I love it love it love it
The progress stops unless you buy coins. I'm at level 15, school and all other crap were built but still no grandma. It's a fun game but progress is slow so u need a lot of patience
But I don't no if hayday is better ??????
This is one of the worst app games I have experienced. It takes forever to finally open, the opening theme literally froze and finally after a couple taps after it was lagging itself to death it skipper to the beginning of the game. After clicking the light-bulb above the women's head the chat screen was huge, so big it only showed the upper left-hand corner of the chat box, so I couldn't even read what she was saying other than three words. Then there was nothing to tap on to get past the chat box, so I had to leave and re-enter to get past her. This game needs a serious update and bug fix. Ever other review has a bug review: family members never coming to help, random game crashes that force u to start all over again. A bad game doesn't earn quick money.
I get mad when I don't have gold coins tho
"I enjoyed playing this game.  At times it was a challenge getting enough coins to move forward or enough energy.  You were always trying to get to the next level and looking for what was going to happen next.  

Starting in the mid-20's levels you were given challenges (quests) that you could not complete until many levels ahead.  You  were forced to spend gold just to removed the quest from the game.  I am now at level 32 and have run out of quests.  While in 31 I was presented with my last quest that could only be completed in level 40.  I can only conclude that the game is over at this point.  So it was fun until it ran out of quests.  Great graphics."
Great game but I wish I could get rid of quests that I don't want to do. It inhibits other game attributes.
I love this game so much
Nice game
Great
Amazing!
At first I didn't like it but I gave it a chance and now it's one of my favorite games!
"Your app is successful(: 
I've really come to enjoy it. 
Great job!"
Since cant play FarmVille I grew to love this game
Very hard game to figure out
This is one of my FAVORITE farm games, I love it. But there is a bug where the screen would go white and freeze and I had to delete it and start all over again. That made me very upset.
Fun
Beautiful graphics. Could be fun.. but the developers need to listen to all of the reviews!!!! Definitely needs a FAQ section in the settings ( like Hay Day has) . Needing energy all the time and withering crops makes it too much like FarmVille and shortens playing time. This game could be a lot more fun if the crops did not wither. You could advance faster if you could play when you wanted and not be tied to a clock...again like Hay Day... No withering crops, unlimited play time and  you are not tied to Facebook to advance.

Amazing game !!!!! I love it
"I love the game! Fun!!!!
But, I have seen Grandma or Grandpa, and I am on level 14! What is going on?"
While a bit challenging to figure out the instructions (still no clue how to find vitamins!) this is a fun game.
I keep searching the shop for a larger trough and I just can't find it. Please fix it or something.
I don't like the fact that I have to use energy to get rid of dead bushes and trees which I don't get any experience points or money for when i cleared them, just not fair. So I will only give this two stars until that's fixed. Also after I got to level 25 and then 26 it stop giving me task to do, I don't know why. And I also wish the phone version was also hd and u can also sync your games from one device to another without have to start another game all over again. I also want to put that why is when the grandma is cleaning the animal pens we can't select another item for her to do while she's sweeping so she can do afterwards.
I love it! I can't stop playing, it's so fun!
It's fun
Normally addicted but it Keeps crashing since the last update :(
Too high coins and shop need lower coins for shops
I like the game overall, BUT. I do NOT like the use of energy to do things!! I wish they would do away with that and just let us play the game! Also, we need more land AND how do you get the G-parents to the farm?? Also, I wish there were an easier way to get bricks and wood!
Doesn't give enough energy to do all the things, and can't find some of the items for the quests.

It's fun so far, kinda confusing but you get the hang of it soon, really cool game
.
Can't get Grandma- The guest house will not allow repair. I'm on level 11 and have completed the cash task  associated w/the guesthouse.
Thanks! It's a good game. I enjoy it.
The point I love this game is every time I farm or do something, I get reward. When the reward drops, I love when I tap and collect(doesn't have to but it's more fun that way). Getting energy is easier than I thought. But some request requires gold coin so I think this game must have menu to refuse quest requires gold coin but for over all, I love it. It's so unusual that I don't uninstall game over a month. You must try for a week at least!!!
Great game to play between hay day sessions.
Is thr a way to move the mail box .also, how do we do fishing ..is thr a way to do fishing pls help pls.
Great game
Great game
fun
I recommend it to people who like farm games it's boring at first but keep playing it gets fun
Not just best farm game also the best iPod game
This app is time consuming but tons of fun
I absolutely love this game and can't believe that it doesn't sync with the game i'm playing on my IPad. PLEASE let me play the same game on my devices.
Best farm game yet. I'm having trouble with grandma though. I can't seem to be able to fix the guest house. I need grandma to visit! Please fix.
This game is cool

"So far, so good. Just started my farm, level 4, and am still playing it. The graphics aren't bad, & game play seems pretty smooth. It would be nice if there was a way to customize your farmer including being able to choose between being a boy or girl. I also play another farming game that doesn't limit how much you can do by how much energy you have, but so far getting/regenerating energy hasn't been an issue. 

Enjoy..... I am,

For now."
This game is fun but doesn't give you enough gold coins.
this is a very fun game i cant stop playing it
Before I found this game, I could not find a good farming game that was not so weird looking and with messed up animals and graphics.  :)
Awesome game!!!
"This game works pretty smoothly. 
Once I got into the playing, found it pretty good."
I downloaded this game, and have been playing it for a month! DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS VERSION!!! Even at level 19, and completing all the achievements, The husband/grandpa/grandma never came. There was even an update on 4/16 and still no relatives to help me save my farm. I finally downloaded FarmupHD and the husband came at level 4!
Be generous about gold this game is not fun boring. Add some fishing farm
I can't get grandma to come bc it won't let me redo guest house! Needs an FAQ area in the settings! With things like how to catch butterflies and how to finally get to get stuff done!
Fun game, I'm a level 29 and have several animal pens but there isn't much room to put them with all the other buildings.  Would be great if you expanded in an update.
why my farm up can't share update on twitter? i need gold.. thx
Need Facebook/Twitter to progress
Ok game kinda like FarmVille
I am in level 12 and neither husband nor grandfather appear so I cannot do anything more or move on when will they appear
Good game but hard to get gold back once you use it and no directions what so ever
Great game totally enjoy it!!
Great game and fun
I loved the game up until I got a white screen and it would not go away deleted the game off and added it back on and I had to start all over again
Easy to earn more lightening bolts and gold. Keeps you interested but not good enough instructions how to get grandpa and grandma to your farm.
I normally do not like games that use energy or premium currencies because they usually make you spend money for them. However in this game, both can be earned at a decent rate and you do not HAVE to use real money. Very addicting!
This is a great game. I enjoy trying to see how much more I can get ahead of the game.  I do wish Grandma and Grandpa would move a little faster:)
Awesome game it's amazing it's a little bad with gold coins sometimes though
Amazing
I love it!!!
Farm up is excellent
Can't get game to work since the update. It just freezes then crashes. Please fix.
I love this game it is so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so so much fun it is the best game in the whole entire world I AM SERIOUS

Great game
It's fun defiantly never endin
It's a fun to play when there's nothing to do
Is good!
Love this game
Love to play. Good game, it would be great if your farmer didn't have an energy bar. You run out of energy fast, crops die before you can collect them.
fun fun fun
So addicted to this game.
A good time waster
I love this game!
It's a great game when your bored love it
I love the game!
Nice game
This game keeps you busy from the get go
Wicked
Fun and addicting!
Farming games are always great, gardens, animals, open space...and this game has all that, but...I wish it didn't require energy to finish tasks, that's not fun!
Interesting twist on a farming game. Most just have you growing plants not improving/repairing other aspects for the farm.
Time killer
Farm up is the best game I have ever played,People that read this should play Farm up.
Fast paced game so far.
Games very interesting, but the time needs to slow down, you pretty much have to be watching it every 15 minutes or your crops will die
This game is sooooooo fun every one who reads this should get the game. This game is soooooo addicting
Fun but to quick! Need to slow down n take da time.
Fun game
I like this game is really fun
Very fun but very similar to Frontireville on Facebook. At least no neighbors needed ;3
The best I luv this game
Great game! No neighbors needed. Finally a game I don't need to rely in others in order to complete tasks.
Love this
Fun game to play
Such an awesome game! Feels real but without the smell!!
Keeps ya busy! Task life will slow ya down. Now grandpa and grandma showed up and it's great game now.
I like playing this game. It's fun and easy and passes time!
I love this game
I like this game so much <U+270C>
Awesome game!  Love how it's so realistic!  Super easy and so much fun!  Great job keep up the good work! :)
The game is a lot of fun!
I love this game
Love this game it is a shame they are not going to continue support for all platforms and operating systems.  It really is a great time management game!
Ahh I got this app today,as I got rid of lots of moles it was very fun.its a 3 star rating
Since the latest update Farm Up tries to get me to connect it to my Facebook account every time I try to play. It's really annoying! I like my little farm, but if the app keeps this up I'll probably just delete it.
I did heaps of the achievements and now I have to do them all again what is going on with this game
Like the game. Good so far.
Thanks for the update but it has real problems ...it keeps freezing for short periods often!!!!....could you please take a look at this...thanks
Why is it I use my arrows I have collected to get a present and I then loose all my coins? What is the use of collecting arrows then if u have to spend coins to buy a present. Is this a fault on the game cause it doesn't seem right to me?
Great game! However when I exit the game, it doesn't save and any of the work I've done such as harvesting crops has gone to waste and I come back and the crops are dead and I've wasted time and coins on the seeds... Fix this and it'll definitely be 5 stars!
Since my update of this game it will not load
I loved this game however am very disappointed now that I have to use the internet to play.
Xcellent & cool game <f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008D>.. A++
Here's three simple words about it: The Best Game!!!!!!!!!!
That's good games to spend times with.!
I love the game but I reckon there should be more achievements I've completed nearly all of them so that's something if love to see in the next update :)
What a great game i love it lots to do and energy can be collected quite easily very good game!
Love this game
I don't think that buying gold coins should be a quest. My family is poor, and we can't afford to spend money on games. On the plus side, I love the game, and the realistic animals. Btw, one of the quests tells you to grow watermelons, which cost gold coins. However, I have not found any way to earn them. Heads up, please?
Good enough. Recommended for player who like farming
Only concern is not enough energy to play for long time. Almost makes it not worth playing. But when plenty of energy all is good. Love the butterflies.
Great game just don't like the energy part
Good game
Cheers
This is so awesome games!!
Really like this game

The game is pretty good except instructions are non existent apart from at the very beginning when you play for first time. Some areas are puzzling because you don't know what to do. Otherwise not a bad game.

Awesome game lots of fun, but I wish energy topped up a bit quicker!
I absolutely love this game.
Good to play on long trips

Good mix of different things

Definatly worth the time
I like it !!
Happily played advert. But live show just hung.  Ver poor app.
"What has happened ? 
I used to rely on this App to keep up to date with my favourite programmes; especially as I work shifts and can't watch them when they are originally aired. Lately though,  I can't even get past the first advert (Why so many adverts ? - assume it's a financial thing).
STV - please address this issue. It's BBC Player for me for now."
I downloaded the app. I read the policies. I deleted the app. 'Nuff said?
"There is too much info required to use this app. The postcode and e-mail address should be enough to confirm you live in the area served by STV and are in the UK. They are obviously using this info with your full name etc to check if you have a tv licence. I have one but am against giving out my full name and address--no thanks STV.
If you want to un- install the app from an iphone or ipad then press your finger onto the app icon till it starts to 'wobble' with a cross above it. All the other apps should be moving too. Just press the cross to delete the app then press your home button to stop all other apps moving. Too much info wanted by this app. A postcode and/or e-mail is all that's required. Untill then- no thanks STV."
Rubbish! Won't let you watch anything until you've surrendered ALL your personal information so they can send you targeted marketing. How do I un-install this annoying app?
Very unstable, continually reverting to the start of adverts over and over....very annoying when you have watched them already.  The programmes stream ok, but the adverts in the middle do not.  Took me 10 minutes earlier to get through one ad break.  Very poor app. Will stop using it. Also has no chromecast interface unlike competitors.
The usual high standard of incompetence....app will not load anything remotely television like...
There is an issue when i click on what i want to watch but then it just takes to me another page with other episodes. Try clicking on an episode and it just reloads the page!
"I have used this on my iPad before updating to ios8 - & it was fine. Now - nothing! 
Rubbish! Get it sorted please! <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00AD>"
"This is the third time I've tried to write a review, throws me out after it says nickname already taken without letting me change it and post.

This app doesn't work. Clicked onto today's Sunday night at the London palladium and nothing. Nothing too if you click on Septembers."
Terrible since the IOS8 update. Keeps crashing near adverts and losing chunks of shows. Also far too many ads, 8 ads every 15 mins. Don't bother downloading this app.
Only installed it to watch DA but you can't stream to the Apple TV with 'some' programmes therefore the app is next to useless.
"Impossible to view any video with this version on iOS 8
Their FAQ says that Flash is required and yet here it is on the Flash free App Store.
Get a grip STV"
Can watch live TV but not a single catch up program.
Complete waste of time. Installed it on my laptop and logged in using email address and still can't watch anything.
This is hopeless.  If you stop watching halfway through, it doesn't keep your place, as BBC iPlayer does.  You have to start from scratch, watch all eight, yes, eight adverts, then find where you were, watch another eight, yes, eight adverts, and only then can you pick up where you left off.
Used to be a pretty good app until recent update which now requires an email, Facebook or Twitter account for live tv, but even though I don't want to watch live tv I STILL HAVE to give over details, I don't want to do this, why is there not another option, I believe the ability to download shows for later should be available too, just so stupid and ignorant,
"When working a cracking app.  Stalls constantly with occasional buffering but just stops and does not restart.  

Would not take much for the developers to get the coding right.  If BBC iplayer and ITV player work well without buffering then it should not be too hard to get thus app working.  

Please fix."
"Got to be one of the worst Apps 
ever!!!
Streaming quality on both ipad and pc absolute rubbish. Agree with earlier reviewer inasmuch that I also object to having to submit so much personal information in order to view. I am deleting this App now!
P.S. Just re-downloaded this App to watch an STV programme, guess what? Developer site apologises for no service due to technical problems!"
Keeps crashing every time I try to watch so etching! Get it fixed STV!
This app does not work, every time I click on a programme it throws me off the app and back to my homepage, completely rubbish app
A lot of bug fixing is needed here as it can at times be glitchy and the sound can cut out, also all the adverts are very off putting
Been ages and still can't stream to Apple TV. Useless.
I use this app to catch up on programmes I've missed but it's not possible now everytime I try to watch something it completely crashes am throws me put the app all together!
App is riddled with glitches can't play anything crashes needs a major overhaul of an update!
I have for a long time had this app for catching up on program's that I've missed. But It has started to glitch out and I can't catchup on any program's
Useless because every time I try to play something it crashes straight away!!!
App is good although recently whenever I try play an episode the app closes completely.
This app is now unusable, just crashes immediately after tapping programme.
So many shows I want to see, particularly on the new STV Glasgow channel, but the app crashes after one tap. Just to compound my misery the feed from the website buffers constantly or just stops playing.
App crashes after one tap, whats the point in using
"Stv get the finger out whats the point in a app tht cuts off after 1 tap...

Looking elsewhere... 

Angry i have to give one star to send deserves  zero.."
I would love to use catch up TV with this app but do not want to use Twitter Facebook etc or my email address so looks like I will no longer be able to use this app which I am so sorry to loose.
What the hell are you ment to do on hhis it's a price of crap!
Crashes as soon as you try to play anything.
Tried to watch the debate last night but couldn't on this rubbish app! Deleted it from my iPad.
Unbelievably bad app. Going to do what the other reviewer does and go via virgin
I deleted this app months ago. I remembered why tonight. I'm Scottish and I live in England and I wanted to watch the debate tonight. Ended up watching it on catch up TV app, much better for anyone that wants to watch anything like this in future. Poor show STV, the world has changed and people demand better technology than this. I'd go as far as saying this app is currently broken.
I download this app to watch the independence debate and this app did not work, so dealing it now
The app rarely logs in, streaming is 60-90s behind live tv and picture quality is poor.....don't bother downloading....itl just frustrate you
Terrible App.  How very embarrassing for STV.  Makes the unwatchable, unwatchable!
Absolute rubbish. Won't let me watch the independence debate. Didn't it occur to anyone at STV that Scots away from home might want to watch this online?! Total horse-poo. Delete
Mince.
The live stream link doesn't work/load up, and the whole interface is a joke. Thanks for ruining my efforts to tune-in LIVE for the Darling-Salmond debate tonight, STV. You absolute dicks.
Total failure. Rubbish player. Rubbish channel.
Will not play programmes at all - perhaps we could borrow the iplayer's code!!!!
"Tried to watch this debate. This APP is rubbish!
Don't bother with it. Permanently deleted from my iPad"
Two puffed up Scottish politicians debate the pros and cons of destroying the UK and 60 million people in England can only watch if they down-load this crappy player because the little people at STV wouldn't let the BBC show it...and it doesn't even play...says it all.
This app is unstable and unusable. It is so bad they should pay compensation for the time I wasted trying to use it. It's an embarrassment in this day and age.
Rubbish
Pitiful
Forces you to login. Live TV never works, just crashes out.
I think I know why it has so many one star reviews. Deleted.
Doesn't work. Crap. Totally useless.
Lots of adverts before show even starts! Somehow ended up on The Sun homepage with no option to go back, so had to delete app altogether! Was told at review stage: 'Nickname already in use', then my review vanished, what a complete waste of time!
5 adverts before a show starts is excessive. Deleted it within minutes of downloading.
When it works the picture quality is very poor - most of the time it doesn't even stream the live feed! Try another app like TV Catchup
Poor - you prevent me from using the itv app and force me to use this then force me to register personal details for no reason. Will watch via virgin app instead.
Since the update I cannot open the ap
V good new app
Downloaded this and went to play some content only to be advised there is a network error and to tap to try again!  After suffering from numbness in all but my pinky finger I came to the conclusion that possibly this is a wallpaper instead of an app!  My current wallpaper is a pic of my grandson (I'm only 40 btw) and I have no plans to replace this especially with a pic of STV app!  I don't ask much but expect an app to work when I download it which clearly this doesn't do!  Get your act together STV at least release an app that works!  Off to nurse my fingers and when I feel mentally and physically ready, I'll press delete!
Good for watching STV news and Scotland Tonight but it needs to be available on Chromecast like the BBC iPlayer and BT Sport. Then I'll use it more and give a 5 Star rating.
It's not that good only has a few and there not even good.they should really get more stuff to watch on there
Poor app. Doesn't remember where you got to so goes back to beginning (including ads). No airplay support. Time lags between ads.
Yes, it does serve up STV content. But... Firstly, there are no subtitles. Worse, adverts are apparently served separately to the content you want to watch; they are frequent, mind-blowingly repetitive, and worst of all, the advert server can't keep up so there are long pauses where nothing happens except the cursor going round and round.
Really just useless. Don't bother trying this as unless you can watch a programme without any sort of break, whether by choice or broadband speed as it always makes you go back to the start with no option to restart from where you left off. What a complete pain!
Really good app although it did keep loading the program and advertisement some of the time. Other than that it's a really good app
What an awful app. Intrusive adverts and buggy. Got 75% of the way through a program only for it to hang. Restarted it but had to sit through 15 minutes of adverts before I could fast forward to the point it crashed. Dreadful. Deleted.
Do yourself a favour and don't even try this app. As previous reviews have said, there is no control. Can't go back, forward or do anything else. Constantly freezes. Picture disappears although you can still hear it. To try and fix you have to go right back to beginning. Why this even got to App Store I'll never know. Completely useless.
Every 15mins of content has 8 adverts. Seems a bit excessive!
This "app" is probably one of the worst apps so far. You cannot rewind or fast forward the programme and after sitting through the repetitive advertisements the programme has sound but yet no picture. So if you cancel your view and restart you are brought back to the very beginning for the programme and if you wish to start off from were you left you are forced to watch the very same advertisements again. It really a waste of time to download this app.
This is a poorly made app. Content has voice track problems, you have to sit through adverts multiple times when trying to fix it. Appalling search mode and very bad navigation. Don't even bother.
One of the worst apps. Constantly crashes. Numerous adverts. STV should be ashamed of themselves expecting viewers to accept this bog standard rubbish. Do not waste your time downloading the app. I have deleted it
Hate how stv player freezes doesn't matter if it's the app or watching on the web have to sit thru adverts constant if it does and takes forever to watch anything hate if I've forgot to tape programmes and have to catch up because of this
Terrible app! So many ads! Crashes loads! Also, really slow to update, for example, the 2030 edition of a programme still hasn't been added at 2230?
the app has no problem playing adverts but struggles to start streaming the actual show and by struggle I won't play at all.... Very poor
Living in Glasgow city centre, you would think that I was within the STV region. No, nothing available here, where exactly does this app cover?
Decent app but too many adverts which you are unable to skip or scroll past, which is just annoying.
It is rubbish that you can only watch things that are near you. Do not get or you are a loser.
I open up app checks my location then shuts down back to home screen!
"Have to sit through adverts before your chosen programme starts. Biggest flaw - you cannot pause, F
fast forward or rewind the programme without starting from the beginning. Lacking basic media player controls. Come on stv, surely you can do better than this???"
Tried it and hated it. The programme had 4 adverts before it starts, 6 adverts at the first break and 7 adverts at the second break. Each advert two minutes?  34 minutes of adverts in a one and a half hour show!  Dumped it and recommend you do not bother using it.
"Not good. Once you start watching you cannot stop and go back to it without starting at the beginning again-and going through all the adverts again. Can scan through but it us tedious in the extreme. 
Needs improving soon."
Nothing on it.
This app is not worth a download! Basically Scotland are being ripped off can't watch so many programmes via live stream. Stv look at sky go as an excellent example of a tv app!
Rubbish itv player App is better don't need to sign in or add  personal information
Like other users I found this kept crashing and returning to the start of the programme. It's impossible to get back to where it crashed as it will only return to ad breaks, of which there are far too many containing the same ads over and over again.  Won't bother with it in future.
"Absolutely useless no live
Programs Not worth a star having to wait days before its on stv player"
Constantly crashes for me
"Someone recommended that I try this app as a replacement for the awful ITV player app which is not fit for purpose. Guess what? They were right! Picture quality is perfect when airplayed to my TV from my iPhone.

The only negative is that the app seems to appear to switch itself off when switching between the program and the ads. It reappears again within a couple of seconds so it's not a huge problem but a bit weird! Also the point in the program at which the ads are switched is very clumsy.

Overall a much better option than the ITV Player app."
I don't like this app because l things they this app is a waste of space on your iPod and iPhone and iPads and l don't like all the breaks in the program and I would like to see the next time for the programs not to have a break
This app works perfectly and I have had no errors so far but the downside to this app is there are too many ads, I ended up with 8 ads waiting for me.
Full of adverts. Will not play anything all the way through. Waste if time.
Every show is spoiled by the same ads over and over again. You can't skip them. Use only when no other platform is available.
Don't know what has happened recently but stv player keeps crashing. Not happy.
Slow interface and low quality and far too many ads makes, no wonder the ratings are poor. Fix it please STV
App loads up but crashes when you try to watch anything.  Should be able to rate an app 0 stars as this definitely deserves a bit fat 0!!
Can't skip adverts, scroll bar at top useless & you can't rewind if you go past a bit you've missed. Total garbage!! <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1>
Never loads , can't watch live and choice is pathetic, wouldn't even give it half a star
"The combination of streaming problems and forced non-skippable adverts makes this unusable. 

My general experience is that it would play the adverts fine but then when it came to the program segment all you get is a spinning wait cursor. And if you fiddle with it to try and kick the streaming back into life, it punishes you with some more ads before failing to play again. 

Very frustrating. Deleted."
The only reason I use this app is because you can't watch the itv for itv1 in Scotland. We're left with the STV equivalent which lacks everything compared to ITV player. Whenever I try and watch a programme I'm confronted with ads! The app crashes constantly. I've never been able to watch a show all the way through without at least one crash, and does the app take you back to where you were last viewing? No! You have to search for the programme again. And then what seems like punishment, sit through all the adverts again. Even when you try and skip the show to where you last viewed it, if they're were 3 sets of ad breaks then you have to watch all 3 AGAIN! STV you've let me down! You can do much better than this! It's time you invest! If no stars were an option that's what id be rating this.
Very frustrating app. Enforced ad breaks made me feel like a child-lock had been placed on my device. STV will have to look at this as it cannot compete with the other many options available to people. Unsophisticated and unintelligent programming and decision making! I'm switching off.
I've never been able to watch a program from beginning to end, they will just stop 3/4 of the way through and ill go back to the home screen! Compared to all the other catch up apps this one is poor!!
Keeps crashing for me every time a try to do anything. Poor app
Horrible
App works perfect for me. Just the thing to catch up on my fave progs with my busy lifestyle.
After getting this app I was looking forward to catching up, but was aggravated that every time the ad break came on for the show I was watching, it would go back to the very beginning of the show. When I tried to fast forward to the place I had left off it would go back to the adverts page and I had to watch them over and over again. Vicious circle and very poor app! STV, your a big company. Get it sorted!!!!!
Awful. Doesn't load anything. Waste of time. Doesn't even deserve the one star. Pathetic!
Good but should be able to download things a watch them later
Plays through ads and then restarts the programme at the beginning every time there is an ad break. Anyone actually test this pile of mince?
I finally get through the first adverts and it just crashes and goes back to I pod homepage, needs an update soon, absulutely terrible!
You watch a programme for so long then it restarts from the beginning, forcing you to watch the adverts again.  And again. And again.  Got so fed up I gave up and paid Apple for the programme on iTunes.
So many adverts. When your trying to watch it, it just freezes and takes such a long time to load! Sometimes it crashes and you need to start from the beginning! Picture quality isn't good, it can go blurry and it's not enjoyable!
And also needs different ads. Same ads throughout the program is incredibly dull!
Unreliable app far to many adverts and they get longer as the program goes on! Then it freezes then it starts from the beginning with ALL THE ADVERTS!!!!
Complicated, and doesn't have the program's from stv until ages after -.-
Seems to work much better than it used to. Haven't had any problems with the new version.
Same ads and it constantly crashes and goes back to the start.  Think I'll stick to my samsung smart tv, you can get itv player on that in Scotland if you insert a non Scottish postcode  ;-)
Works better than itv player and has more content quicker just ashame about the adverts!
I have tried to watch Corrie tonight & I have lost count of the number of times the app has frozen! I have deleted it & reinstalled but keeps on freezing. Get a grip STV!
Started off working fine but like other reviewers said, when you pause the programme, it crashes. The ads are incredibly annoying too. I also had to uninstall then reinstall the app 3 times, on the third download, there was sound but no picture. Goodness sake sort this out. I'm a working mother and I want to catch up on tv shows on my ipad, unfortunately I can't due to this app crashing and then not working properly when it DOES decide to half-work. Sort it out!! Please!!!
It's a very good and fast app. No problems with freezing etc but it doesn't get a 5 star due to still having add breaks during shows! Very behind compared to some other tv apps
A good facility to have, but in other ways very frustrating. Same ads are repeated at each break, and become invasive. Maybe being an irritant is effective for advertisers but very bad for viewers. And if you pause for too long, app crashes and you have to start over again. Best to let an hour programmr run 50mins and then scroll back to start; ads will skip. A case of management and bean counters alienating viewers. Not an effective policy for viewing figures and thus advertising revenue, so policy makers are shooting themselves in the foot. Well done STV.
Works much better than previous versions. Much better at finding my location...
Very good - easy to use, stable and fast.
Does what it says. Works well
"STV is utter rubbish.  I wish Northern Scotland had the franchise for proper ITV1 instead of watching London ITV1. Can't even get ITV1 HD or STV HD on sky. We pay the same tv licence and Sky subscription as England! 
ITV Player is better by miles.  I use that app instead!"
Pile of utter crap...wish I'd read the review before I allowed it to frustrate the hell out of me.
Really rubbish app, very rarely get all the way through a programme as it cuts off and I have to watch all the adverts over and over.
Waste of time. Watched first part of 1 hour programme with increasing interest, then at first advert, the player reverted to very beginning of programme. Same happened at each advert after taking several attempts to pass first one. Managed to see whole program, but it took 2 hours and I had lost interest. Infuriating. Wished I had never started.
Some day, ITV will finally get rid of you and bring Scotland glorious HDTV and a at least passable app. I can't wait for that day.
Simply does not work. This needs sorted. Embarrassing.
Keeps crashing and there is hardly any shows available :(
Awful - restarts the programme at every advert break and on most occasions you can't get it to then start playing again. Come on STV  - cant understand why the reviews haven't embarrassed you into some kind of action. Will not be watching!
Won't even open - whats the point? Get it sorted or just take down from App Store!!!
Absolutely shock this is,doesn't work ... It just says 'checking location' for hours
It won't work even in Scotland.
What a waste of time if I wanted to watch adverts I would just watch the program why can't it be like on demand 22 min program 4.5 mins of adverts
Doesn't work, don't waste time downloading.
When it says checking location keep tapping the right corner then it should work like. It has for me.
Wont work fix asap
Stuck on checking location!
This app works on my I phone but not on my I pad. Why can it not be fixed STV needs to read the bad reviews and sort it out, afterall they are a significant broadcaster in Scotland.
Don't waste your time
Love it
Could'nt get pass the location but as a reviewer said,press top right corner then press dismiss&after that press programmes&it should work.
Only problem is that it doesn't work !!!!!
Why does it exist
No iPhone 5 support, always crashes, far too much ads
If you are struggling to get it working as soon as you click the app keep tapping the top right corner. That's how I got it to work.
Why bother? Stuck on checking location
Absolutely rubbish. Reverts back to beginning of a programme at each set of adverts, then, should you be so lucky to make it someway approx half or 2/3 through a programme it just freezes & stops the auto screen save so keeps iPad active so drains the battery. Better fix it quick or we'll all stop watching ITV/STV. Oh..and btw why does it matter where I live if I'm watching on demand tv....? You do not need to check my location - other on demand tv apps don't require this before they'll activate
Need to fix the ads or tbh get rid waste eh time.
Not sure if they have tested this version but I have just downloaded and it fails miserably.  Checked it had access to location services. All seems well, but the app doesn't work.
Gets stuck on a loop trying to find location! Can't use it! Rubbish!
Everytime it comes to an advert it restarts!
Can't watch a full programme, jumps back to start after each ad break. Ever heard of testing?
Constantly throws you back to the start of the programme. Have now given up out of sheer frustration. Utter rubbish. Doesn't work. Useless.
It gets stuck when searching for my location ://
Just doesn't work..........unless you are just want an app to constantly pay you the same adverts as you patiently try over and over to watch a complete programme have to restart everytime  it crashes.
This is so infuriating, I like to watch my programmes on player at a later time but since Xmas this is impossible. They sometimes dont get past location, then if they do they will not play past the first break so far I have never seen a programme in full, how can I catch p with my series watching???????? I am so very cross with this new set up tried emailing but they havn,t bothered to tell me how to resolve it.
Work perfectly fine though too many adverts let it down !
Absolutely rubbish! Waste of time downloading!
Firstly it won't load as it says it cannot find my location even when I live in the Highlands of Scotland. Secondly because I have an ipad in now won't let me watch STV on it because I have to download the app. Frankly I wouldn't even consider downloading it.
Too many adverts & it keeps freezing & chucking me completely out of the app! Not impressed at all!
Don't waste your time. Didn't experience any of the location problems experienced by other users but the thing just doesn't work. Keeps returning to the start of a programme after every ad break. The scrub tool only works intermittently, then still chucks you back to the opening credits after the ads. And to top it all, it'll occasionally just freeze up altogether. Absolutely AWFUL app.
The app doesn't remember how much of a programme you've watched so every time you leave the app, close the iPad cover or the app crashes you have to watch the initial 4 adverts and then another 4 when you skip to the point where you think you are.
This app doesn't work !!! All i get is " checking location" thats it :((
"How can this so called ""APP"" fail to identify my location when my laptop works ok when using the same router? This clearly identifies my location in Aberdeenshire, well within the broadcast area of STV.
I suggest the coding requires some modification to correct this problem.
It also would be an improvement if some ability to skip those repulsive adverts were added?
I do wish we could return to the old days of ""Grampian Television"", at least we knew it was local."
Hi the stv player app takes Ages to find my location and locks up
3 times in the space of less than an hour, the programme stalled and made me start again from the beginning. Every time it started again, it made you go through the adverts. Even if you try to fast forward, it still goes through every advert. Very, very annoying!!
"This app doesn't work. All I get is a blank screen saying ""Checking Location..."".
Pity we can't give 'minus stars'..."
The app does what it's supposed to do. It picks up my location fine and plays the programmes. A little slow and too many ads but bearable.
I live in liverpool n it dont work! Think its like it for everyone!
This app is awful, doesn't even work!!!!
Utterly hopeless! Keeps "checking location" and nothing happens. This app DOES NOT work. Please read these reviews and fix this ASAP! I live in Scotland too!
Isn't able to find my location in Scotland. Too many adverts and stalls all the time and when you move forward the adverts start again! Simply unwatchable!
Awful can't find my location how hard can it be to find the West of Scotland on Scottish television
Brilliant app, plays with no issues
Consistently fails to recognise I'm in Sctland!
"Every time it gets to an ad break (and there were 5 in an hour long programme) it skipped back to the beginning of the show and wouldn't let me fast forward to where I had been up to. They advertise this on the TV constantly as a great way to watch the shows you've missed, but for me it's a total waste of time and means that I'll have to ensure I watch things when they're on or not bother at all.

Sort it out."
Awful. Cannot even get past location! Worst app I think I've experienced.
"Never finds my location either.
Do you have to be in the STV area to get this? I'm in the border reception area."
Awful, never finds my location
This is a terrible app! I had to reninstall as the first version stopped working. The newer version is even worse as it just constantly tries to find your location even when 'location services'  are on for this app! Its a joke that itv and stv have such convoluted area restrictions anyway, half the programmes aren't even available for iphone viewing. STV - waken up.  Please tell stv or write review if you're having same issues.
God man, get this fixed. It's got more bugs than an episode of I'm a Celebrity Get Me Out Of Here. Just cuts out and doesn't even remember where it cutout so you need to go back to the start of the program you're watching.....and watch all the Ads again. Not great!
I wanted to watch Mr Selfridge at my own leisure and in the end it was a torturous ordeal. App kept jumping back to opening scene after each ad break and the further through the programme it kept sticking. In the end I couldn't get to the final section, hassle not pleasure, rubbish.
Awful app - keeps crashing during programmes.
This stupid app wont find my bloody location Not even with a star but I have  to give it something
Dreadful app, poor quality picture and crashes all the time unless you are watching adverts!!
Its just as well it is FREE...Plays all the adverts (far too many of them may I add) and after 1st half of programme it then plays all the ads AGAIN but then when u wait on 2nd part, it puts it right back to the beginning of programme...SORT IT OUT OR GET RID :@
This app is terrible,doesn't load keeps coming up 'location services' one of the worse apps I've ever used!
Not sure why all the one star ratings, app opened, found location and had me watching Mr Selfridge all in under a minute! Maybe I was just lucky? Ok the ads are a little annoying, but life goes on! We will see how I get on next week. Well worth the download to see how you get on, don't be too put off by all negative reviews.
As other reviews. App is junk as it simply won't load from location services
This (cr)app only gets worse with time! I've tried sticking with it but now think the time has come to delete. Do the app makers not read the reviews? I rarely see a positive one. It either freezes when it finally uploads or you get sound and no picture. So disappointed!
Said no to location services hoping it would let me watch. Didnt work. Wouldnt let me turn it back on without goint to settings at turning it on for the app. Still didnt work. Reinstalled to be asked wether to use current location, selected ok..... Still didnt work!
i have just updated this app as i had been experiencing difficulty with it, pausing etc. It's no better, if anything marginally worse. I can't watch one program without the screen going black and only getting sound. I've tried everything; pausing, starting it again, deleting and reloading app but still no luck. Not good at all!! Would be great if this could be fixed asap! All i want to do is catch up  on the Corrie that I've missed!!:(:(
I am Scottish but I  live in England and it won't let me watch any programmes as I don't live in Scotland, I think this really is unfair also the app keeps freezing and saying checking location - Do Not Download!
No stars really just keeps telling me checking location deleted and tried twice more terrible
This app doesn't even let me get passed searching for location and my location server is not on
Couldn't even use it! Said 'Checking Location' for about half an hour even on the wifi! Gave up, wouldn't bother with it.
I think it's really bad you can't get int it so there is no point of getting it its just a waste of your time so there is no point of downloading it its just the same on the play station DON'T  DOWNLOAD IT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
This just doesn't work properly and there are too many adverts! I appreciate its a free app but if it worked properly and was advert free I'd seriously consider paying for it!
Terrible app requiring lots of work to make it usable, freezes, shuts down, picture goes blank while dialogue continues - must make it better
This app is so frustrating, do not install it otherwise you risk your sanity.
Constantly showing checking location so can't even get started. Given up after a week of trying................
Very frustrating app, adverts cause programme to return to beginning then freezes when you try to get back to where you were, forcing you to restart the player and watch the adverts all over again. Needs fixing.
Can't fast forward the ads. Jumps back to beginning. Once programme starts again and you try to forward to where you think you were it shows more ads then goes back to beginning. Frustrating!!
Absolute rubbish! Has been 'checking location' for ages now! Is this replacing itv player? Hope not, it's crap!
Gets stuck at the location screen, waited ages and still nothing.
Utterly pointless app.  Doesn't work properly and the picture quality is a joke!
Don't bother to download - doesn't work. Freezes, goes back to the beginning for no reason, jumps back sections and loses picture so you get sound only. Complete waste of time.
Don't bother as it still doesn't work.
Gets stuck at the location screen.
Location still does not work and will not allow app to work, rubbish as this is what the update was meant to sort!!!!!
Stv player app is in my top 5 of rubbish apps. Completely disappointing.
Rubbish! Gets stuck finding location and then doesn't load!
Freezes, returns to the start at each advert break. Loses its place on returning to part-watched programme. Poor. Wouldn't recommend for iPad even using iOS 5
"Why do programmes continually go back to the start following the ad breaks?

Surely you can do better than this STV."
Rubbish. It didn't even load at all!
How inept do you have to be to release two STV apps that either don't work or are so far behind the times they are pointless. The STV Player app can not find my location so does not load. Like so many previous versions of the STV news app it appears that proper testing is never carried out or the infrastructure isn't scaled to deal with demand. The STV news app has had the same problems for many versions, now it works but is updated so infrequently it's not worth reading.
Very slow, once ads kick in it takes you right back the start. Very frustrating. Half the time it doesn't play. Sound, no picture!
STV player I have just got this app and so far it's quite slow and not working but it could be good when it starts working
STV crashes into 2013 with an app that can't find my location!!!!-pure genius...I've come up with a word for the "S" in the acronym STV that describes this app perfectly...
"... as was suggested in the FAQ's somewhere. Same iPad, different supplier (BT), different location (Perthshire) and it's still crashing when 'checking location'. Just fix it!

Oh and NEVER release an update just before the staff all b****r off on holiday!"
Utter waste of time reinstalled 3 times have sound but no pictures ??
"This app does not work because location detection is faulty.
Why not use the code from the desk top version which does work from the same IP address?"
The app can't find my location, utter garbage .......
I can hear the program but I can't see it. Sit through all those adverts to get nothing. One advert would be enough.
This App is completely useless and I would not recommend any download it.  The App has issues with trying to find your location.   Really poor!!!
Will play the ads ok, but not the selected programme
With respect, you need to fix this app. It does not load further than "checking location" ... And I waited for 17min!! You're loosing viewers by not having technology that works!
Hmmm... A pretty spectacular fail for this version on the IPad 3rd gen... Any hope of a bug fix pronto? Apparently I don't live in an STV region despite living in the central belt.  Still, it's an improvement on yesterday when it wouldn't even open. Sort it out!
No picture no use. Sound only. Used to be ok
Just bought app thanks for reviews!
Pointless. app doesn't work, gets stuck the "Checking Location". FAQ on the STV web page was no help. Gives the impression that they make content available to the whole UK but the blurb on the App Store says Northern regions only. Which is it? Don't waste your time, I did for an hour and that's an hour I'm never going to get back. Read other feed back, all one stars.
Not got past the "Checking Location..." Useless.
Was looking forward to Christmas catch up plays ads perfectly but program cuts to sound only after first few minutes disappointing app not worth the hassle :-(<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0081> can't even give one star but I've got to<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0081><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0081><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0081>
what a very poor app - does not work
Why can't I get STV player to recognise my location here in GLASGOW home of Scottish television? There are only a few programmes available to watch on ITV player. WHY?
I downloaded it to watch Coronation St on the ipad but it keeps crashing when I allow it to use my location and it appears that it's not only me that's had this trouble. STV sort this out I have Coronation St to watch!
Crashing after the location check.
Since latest update this app does not even open ! Had been working well until then . Get it sorted please!
Latest version does not work at all. An error message flashes on screen for fraction of a second which is too quick to read what it says ! Tried deleting and re-installing but now it won't even install. Come on - pull the finger out and get it fixed. Gave it one star only cos u cannot give it zero stars
Can't even set it up - crashes every time it checks my location. Pretty frustrating when you're forced to use this rather than ITV player. One star rating is more than it deserves.
Randomly works - worse since upgrade, not good at all
I'm not exactly Ure what to say about this app I love vein able to wayh stv portably but you still have to watch the adverts as it dosnt let you skip them I find this really really annoying its gotten worse recently used to he three now its seven
Just like everyone else is saying crashes even before your properly in the app
"This has to be the worst app ever.
It was bad enough before the update but I can't get it now cos it can't find my location! I'm in Scotland not outer Mongolia.  Stv have the nerve to keep shoving the add for their app in our faces but they would be better employed spending money correcting this apology for an app."
App doesn't work at all so isn't even worth one star. Crashes after checking location.
The picture and sound keep cutting out. The only parts of the programme I can watch normally are the ad breaks. Very poor app.
Not even worth half a star
"Doesn't even start. Fails on a location check. Very poor quality software, not worth the price.

Yes, I know it's free."
"I used this app to catch up on Corrie, but oh I can't view Anything because of
My location? It was fine before the update. Going to have to watch Corrie on the computer again!"
Can't load at all. Asks to check location and freezes. Not worth the grief.
Garbage - is this the sign of things to come once devolution is declared?
Whenever an ad break finishes the player either goes back to start of the programme or stops completely. Pretty poor
Keeps losing the picture, then left with the sound, so not much use
"As the title says

Before then it was a great app. 
Please fix it ASAP"
Have tried to use this app and it can never get beyond location finder I have turned on my location for it but it still can't find me any suggestions
You've just updated this app which I thought was quite good and was looking forward to the update for the following reason but after the update STILL no support for iPhone 5 screen size, it isn't hard to adjust some resolutions and replace images & change layout slightly, pure laziness.  Terrible :-/
Downloaded this app on iPhone and iPad and works on neither, fails to recognise I'm in Scotland and doesn't let me watch anything. Very frustrating. Even when trying to watch it on normal Internet it re-directs me to the app so can't watch any programmes. Very disappointing.
It keeps cutting out and closing once the ads come on so then I have to open it and look for the bit I got to in the programme. Terrible and very frustrating!!!!
I have just installed the app and nothing works. I have just read some of the reviews. At least I know it's not me.
Doesn't pick up your postcode, so will not allow you to view programmes.  When you do manage to get it to recognise your post code, you get ten mins of adverts, then when your chosen prog eventually plays....it buffers for ever and you get no picture, you only get sound with the QuickTime logo.  Too many bugs and glitches. Rubbish app!
Just downloaded this app and tried 3 times to watch something and all 3 times I couldn't even get past the first 4 adverts. Not amused.
I have attempted to watch an episode of Coronation Street 12 times now but it keeps on crashing! I give up!
Wow! This is really too crap for words.  Way too many adverts and crashes all the time.  Really bad lay out too, very disappointing.
STILL RUBBISH.   FREEZES.  Too many ads     Rubbish waste of time all other players WORK.  Yours certainly does NOT
Am in Midlothian, just south of Edinburgh, ISP is Demon based in London, done a ip check. But no can't use it, total rubbish
This is just what I was waiting for. Hated not being able to watch corrie on catch up! I read the previous reviews but have no issues at all. It never asked me to accept ant terms and conditions though. Maybe the bug has been fixed now? Possibly delete and reinstall.
This does not work..... BBCI player far superior... Sort it out.. Itv has great programmes, shame unable to view..
It's saying something about that I live in Scotland I can't do any shows at all!!!Do not install this it is rubbish.;(
Has been an absolute joke!! Why advertise such a great app on tv when it clearly doesn't work!!!!!
Can't watch a thing. The current location set up is a total joke.
Anytime I click to watch I'm a celeb and click yes to the terms and conditions it does nothing and nothing plays. How do I fix this
It need a update so that we can watch I am a celebrity get me out of hear in scotland or does someone know how to sort it because it is so annoying that I cannot watch any good programs
"
"Well I was watching I'm a celebrity and ads didn't bother me much didn't buffer at all played flawlessly.

Only thing I'd say was there was 6 or 7 ads at the beginning, a bit too much 4/5"
"On first appearance it looks good BUT that is where it ends! It plays a millions adverts if you click any program at any time in the program or advance (fast forward) the program to try and get it to play. It just will not play at all ever!!!
I've got 70mb fibre one of the fastest in the UK and I couldn't get this App to play anything at all, it just egg times forever or stuck on the same image forever!!!!
Geeeezzzz this was the poorest cr@p I've seen in a long time. I've just wasted 30 minutes of my life trying to view just one program and I saw NOTHING at all.
I'm going back to TV Catchup despite it's cr@p picture.

does not play any content if you advance the"
Not sure what everyone is complaining about, Programmes are all updated in good time & streaming quality is good
Was working fine till today then halfway through a programme it cuts off and closes the app then when you try access the app it says you don't live in the correct region when I do live right in the middle of STV region! Very annoying!
This app is terrible. Does not have most shows and the most recent one was on the 19th of October. Waste of time, don't bother. If i could rate it 0 stars I would.
Have been happily using the stv player through the web browser on my phone with no problem at all and then they bring out this app. App doesn't have all the shows that the stv player on web has, and the shows that it does have buffer constantly and then don't play and you have to watch 6 adverts to get it. BRING BACK THE STV PLAYER ON WEB. It worked perfectly without a hitch. I downloaded to watch vampire diaries that is on itv2 but doesn't have it on app?! Has it on web stv?! What's right in that. If you didn't spend so much time advertising this crap app on the tv and spending that money improving it you might have better reviews. Sort it out.
To be honest, this app doesn't even deserve 1 star... For a start, the location services are rubbish - one minute it allows you on and the next it decides you're not it Scotland anymore... I wanted to watch the X factor and instead got to watch 6 adverts and 30 seconds of the actual programme before being cut off and the app shutting down completely... Complete waste of time. To be honest STV, I don't think there's really any point having this app unless major improvements are made (although in the state this app is in it may be better just starting from scratch). Some serious issues here and a LOT of work to be done. Massive disappointment.
Complete rubbish. Constantly freezes when your simply trying to watch something. The forward and rewind fader just consistently crashes if you try to use it. Better f recording programmes rather than trying to watch them on this piece of junk.
Why do idiots in Belfast think they can watch Scottish television. The app works perfectly very slick and will no doubt get better with time 4 stars meantime
4 program's on it YES!!!! FOUR, are you kidding!!!
The app continually freezes and the fast forward doesn't work: not a good combination. Occasionally suggests my location is outwith Scotland when I'm actually in Glasgow. Does it know something I don't? Previous web version was actually more reliable.
App is unusable constantly crashes have watched 2 mins of footage in total in between crashes. Sack your developers STV
Hate it can't even get it in Belfast
Crap
Can't add my postcode to prove that I live in Central Scotland.  I bet this app would work if Glen Michael and Arthur Montford were still working at STV.
even though updated it made it worse and it's rubbish freezes and breaks down it was fine before when u didn't have to download the app rubbish
This is an absolutely rubbish app all I can do is watch the ads then it kicks me of the app don't even waist your time downloading it!!! <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1>
This app is rubbish please don't waste your time downloading it! Unbelievably bad!
"Why can't you fast forward and I really do not want to see that man in his speedos on any advert again. It's sick and totally unacceptable. This shouldn't have adverts! Get a grip stv, your a disgrace to Scottish tv!! Very bad app not even worth 1 star!
Deleted !!"
It won't work for me at all, got it so I could watch I'm a celebrity and it won't even open. It is a total waste of time. If I could I would give no stars. Get this fixed please?
"Waist of time 
It's absolutely rubbish app, havent been able to watch nothing...living next to stv building but can't get a coverage... Then it's suppose to cover Scotland lol"
Terrible app - it does not allow you to watch xfactor only some boring programme called coached of the couch. Now come on help a sister out that makes you want to go to sleep. YAWN !!!!!!!!
WORST APP EVER!!!!!!
Trying to catch up on my I'm a celbrity and its poor quality, and then it stops showing the picture just plays the sound... I want to watch it aswell as listen to it. <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1>
Downloaded to watch last night's I'm A Celeb, and I'm sitting with good and fast wifi, and it takes about ten minutes to load an advert, then another ten minutes to load the programme, then it stops half way through and goes back to the start.
Does not work in Scotland. Very poor!
Very little content, useless...
I want to be able to watch STV Live. ITV Player does this but will not let you view ITV1 if you live in Scotland. This is discrimination.
This app looks good but does not function correctly and is not consistent.
It's good when it's working, but every now and then it says I can't watch the content because I live in Scotland, and the day before I watched it when I was sitting in exactly the same seat. Then it works within the next 2 hours. Annoyed
Just downloaded if to watch show and there are only 3 programmes available on the whole app. I'm just deleting it straight away, as it's a waste of time, and judging by the other comments, you need to get a grip.
Crashes, too many adverts, rubbish. Needs fixed soon
Have just turned on this app & it's telling me I can't get the tv shows when last night I was able to watch the tv on it. What's happened over night. Now I think I will just give it 1 if I don't get the programmes back on screen. Had to install it again.
I've just downloaded this app it's terrible it crashes all the time you get to many adverts, your half way through Cori and it doesn't go any further I thought maybe with the last update it would have fixed the bugs but no! Bring back the other stv player least it worked   Disappointed:(
This app is no good if you want any programmes that are aired for Edinburgh and the East. Even if you allow your location or put your postcode in, it doesn't pick up your area
"Downloaded then deleted 30 mins later.
Keeps quitting.  Too many ads."
Cannot even get it to work! Does no one care! Do not give us an app that does not work! It is hit and miss .I want to watch corrie not listen to it.
I hate the stv player, it loads, but the number of adverts is far too many and always repetitive.  How many times do i need to watch the rbs lost card advert, every single programme, prior to starting, after, and in between. Aaargh!! I hate that i can no longer watch stv.tv/player without the app because im using an ipad. Either remove this app or fix it properly.
I was about to post a review stating that latest update had made no difference as app was still crashing constantly and then when you tried to return to where you were in a program you had to endure endless adverts to restart it.  However, I then saw previous reviewers comment about uninstalling and reinstalling so gave it one last go and it seems to have worked.
This app tells me im not in an appropriate location to view their material.  I live in argyll and bute not the southwest of england.  It also takes too long loading, like so many other video apps.
"Watch a few things on it, and it works okay. Programmes played in full, bit a bit slow bringing up ads, but no problems with the programmes. People should try removing app and reinstalling it. 
Now have STV player on both my iPhone and ipad. Braw"
"Since I have downloaded this app I have been unable to watch any program at all, even after downloading the new update. It is completely rubbish.

STV get a grip!!"
Got the first 15 minutes to run ok but now keeps ticking over and trying to sync. Absolutely dreadful! I've watched almost every downton on stv player and using the Ap is the first time I've had a problem. Please please fix it otherwise I certainly won't be back.
Unbelievably bad app. Have been unable to get it to play anything.
Very time I go on it it tells me to turn of the notification in the settings I do it and it dus not work
Evrytime I watch somthing get to half way then turns of
Very disappointed with app:( always cuts off during program's!!!
"Sorry but app is terrible! I am in the STV area and have my location enabled but this keeps crashing on me after about 10 seconds.  It's so frustrating!
I did see the reviews weren't very good but thought I would give it a try anyway. Shouldn't have bothered really."
Cldnt watch anything because it just keeps freezing! Adverts play perfectly tho!
App works fine in STV area most of the time although I have had to restart programmes twice before being able to watch them.
Keeps freezing and crashing.
Honestly so annoying, played the adverts fine and then when it comes to the actual programme it just came up a black screen and just the sound of the programme. Tried it on multiple devices and had the same results. Disappointed.
Rubbish app keeps on freezing the adverts play ok but always freezes when the programme come on there was never a problem before watching thru the web site Get this sorted
"I have managed to watch lots of adverts but not one programme. The app just freezes mid opening titles and /or it looses the picture of the programme but not the ads - weird how the advertising works fine. 
Please sort this ASAP!"
Crashes all the time and has too many adverts!
After the 4th time of crashing this this has now won the award of the worst app I've ever used! Tried to download ITV player but because of my postcode I'm stuck with this stinker! Don't waste your time downloading this. I've given it one star because I had to.
Was really looking forward to catching up on Downton - thought there must be a problem with my iPad - until I read other reviews and realised I am not alone!!! NOT GOOD STV -please sort this out ,situation was much better when it was a download.
Rubbish -dont waste your money - only plays initial adverts but when the programme you want to watch comes on, it freezes! Please fix and advise when it's been done :(
"what a waste of time, it won't run, it keeps freezing - they shouldn't have bothered. the website worked fine, this app simply does not.

you'd think they'd have tested it first to make sure they were providing their customers with a reasonably robust piece of software. I hope STV get a refund from the firm they employed to write this appallingly bad app.

and if they had it done in-house, then they need to scrap this effort and hire a software engineer who actually knows what they're doing."
The app never allows me to watch anything passed the first ad break except repeats of the ad break.
Way to many adverts!!! Its all about the money!!
So many negative comments. Have downloaded this stv player and have been using it with no problems. The only thing I can fault it on is the adverts played before and during a episode but apart from that it is a great app to catch up on "Scottish tv"
"This app crashes all the time, freezes in the middle of programmes and at times, doesn't even load them. I live in Scotland - why can't we get itv player which works perfectly? Surely the Internet is not location dependant in Scotland - I thought that was only Russia and China?

Oh, and the adverts are ridiculous, repetitive and annoying - I will deliberately never bank with RBS or shop at Littlewoods or buy Always Ultra sanitary towels as I have seen their adverts 8 times in the course of trying to watch one half hour programme on this pile of crap app."
This app has changed.  It never used to have so many adverts before the programme and none in the breaks.  I do not want to sit watching 5 minutes of adverts when I'm trying to CATCH UP! Poor show from stv.
Have never written a review before but like many others felt compelled to as this app is so frustrating and constantly freezes during playback!! Sort it out STV!!
Worst tv app ever. Don't waste your time downloading no matter how desperate you are to watch Downton Abbey. You will only be disappointed.
Useless App. Plays the ads and only 10 secs of programme then crashes. Doesn't work. Don't download
I too, cannot get the location or Postcode to work. Sent an email to STV player a week ago - still no reply. Please fix this STV - I love your programmes.
This is rubbish! Even if you allow it to use your location and enter your postcode, it still says you can't see Scottish content!
Worst app I have ever downloaded. Completely useless. Plays about 4 minutes of the programme you actually want and then freezes. When you try and restart from where it decided to give up it manages to play all FIVE adverts before the show actually starts when surprise surprise it just crashes again. What a waste of time. Worst part being you can't then just watch what you wanted on ITV because of your location. You would be better off not bothering.
This has been terrible- now can't watch stv on iPad. Never written an app review before but compelled to complain. Please fix it freezes constantly.
I used to watch stv through the Internet and all was well but now this isn't an option from my ipad and I have to use this app. It freezes much more than it plays and I have to sit through the adverts. Don't bother downloading. It hardly ever works. Really disappointed. This needs fixed soon.
awful app!  keeps freezing/crashing.
Wort app I've used, keeps freezing, adverts take a long time, the screen just goes black sometimes and doesn't show the picture, skips parts of what your watching. Terrible.
Great if you only want to watch adverts
I only give it 1 star so I can submit this review. I agree with everything that's been said. Sort it STV
Just tried to watch a programme & have found the same issues as everyone else. It is so frustrating that the adverts play okay but not the programme. Until STV can fix the bugs this app is a frustrating, time wasting app!
I managed to watch the first part of a programme but then it went off and kept crashing and the adverts take ages! If you can't make the app decent, then don't bother at all, we would rather just search it up the Internet which was much better
unwatchable. freezes, sticks. not managed to watch even one programme all the way through yet. dont bother with it
Waited a long time for an app for Scottish TV, still waiting. Seems I am not allowed any of the content due to my location - Aberdeen!
Terrible, cannot watch anything and really annoying........would put you off watching soaps. Could not submit without a star........they do not deserve it.
Can't even get the app to load! Constantly crashes whenever it's opened and can't watch anything! There should be an option to give no stars! At least they didn't charge for the privilege of downloading such a useless app! :(
This app does not work adverts played fine but programme froze, nothing Is happening I am soooooo!!!!!! Annoyed arrrrhhhhh!!!!!!!!
Soooo frustrating , worst app ever , get it sorted !!!!!
Rubbish, rubbish, rubbish!!!!!!! Should be zero!! Adverts work perfectly fine, once they are finally over the content freezes! Load of crap, not going to use again!
Absolutely rubbish does not work at all or stops working! Most rubbish app !!
You have ruined my X factor experience!! I always miss it on a sat due to work and have watched it on my iPad on your website every week since it started and had no problems!! Now you have decided to make an app which is rubbish and doesn't work!! Plus it has adverts which the website didn't have which is a mega bonus since now it's takes 2 minutes to watch the next part!! Why scrap the app and bring back your website?? Idiots!!!!!! P.s. I really give you a zero rating!!!
This app is complete rubbish, I agree with all the other bad comments and also wish I could rate it zero...I am very disappointed as its the only way I catch up with stv programmes on my iPad and now get very frustrated....get it sorted
Worst idea stv have had, it never works and I can't even go on the website anymore unless I'm on a laptop. STV GIT yer finger ooot!
Doesn't work!!!!!!
Agree with the comments on all the other reviews here. STV, if you are going to give people no option but to download this, at least take the time to give us an app that actually works!  Extremely disappointed and would be rating it zero stars if I could.
Please sort out this app. I have to agree with all other reviews it really is appalling after having no choice to download it to catch up on favourite programmes. The app constantly crashes and does not stream properly and there is 3 times more adverts than the last stv player. Come on get your it together!!!
What a Waste of time this app is,  crashes all the time very frustrating
What a waste of time, would have given no star rating at all but that wasn't an option!! Before this app I could watch STV online no problem with the added bonus of no ads. Tried to watch a few programmes which all start with ads that play no problem at all, as soon as the title music starts each programme freezes and in the end I caught up with nothing. I don't know why STV decided to 'upgrade' the catch up service to an app, there are major flaws in the current version which is not presently useable :-(
At first I thought great there is finally an app but when I tried to catch up on programmes it kept freezing & jumping! Ended up giving up on it after 1 hour! Too much adverts too! Not impressed!
Managed to view before using news app - been for ed to download app and it is terrible  _ can't access 2 nd episode of DUI banks and first one just freezes constantly - get it fixed !!!
Dreadful app that constantly crashes. So fustrating when wanting to watch a missed programme.
This app is hopeless. I used to use the mobile web version of stv player and had no issues but now you're forced to use this app and its a real pain. I only really use it to catch up on Corrie and I'm lucky if I can get through 5 mins without it freezing or getting a black screen at which point I usually have to start over again. It's not my device nor my network coverage which is perfect. Please someone do something, or at least bring back the mobile web version as a back up which worked far better!
Sat down to watch corrie on the stv website which I have used before but was forced to download the app. When I went on the app I had to watch 5 adverts which all paused many times. Finally when the corrie theme tune came on it froze completely and wouldnt let me carry on watching. They really need to get this fixed.
Was forced into downloading app this am when I went online to catchup on Corrie.  One and a half hours later!! I've given up as the beginning of the second episode seems to have frozen for all time.  STV you need to get this sorted out. Also, my true rating would be zero stars.
Was looking forward to using this app. Discovered that it is horrible to use and a waste of time!
Terrible
Was so much better before u made it an app, u can't fast forward all those adverts!!! Constantly freezes, absolutely rubbish STV - u really need to sort fast!!!
Really awful, keeps crashing, adverts annoying, the STV  player online was 100% better. Please. Fix!!
Does not work at all!
Only works when watching ads then crashes a few mins into tv show <f0><U+009F><U+0092><U+00A9>
it keeps crashing, sort it out!
Have not even managed to get through the introduction of the xfactor which is what I downloaded it for. On further attempts can't even get past the adverts before it begins!!!!!!! Very annoying!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Worst app I've ever used. Sort It out!
Worst app ever, kept on crashing and freezing. A load of <f0><U+009F><U+0092><U+00A9>
Freezes all the time you try to watch a program what is the point of this app pure rubbish ,,,,,,,,,,
"Froze and was not recoverable after second set of adverts in Emmerdale live!
No way of getting back to desktop site on iPhone!
Sort it out!!!!!"
This app is no good. Besides the glitches eg. video freezing and controls not showing, it loses functionality that the web version had such as AirPlay. The iOS optimised website has just been shut down so this pretty useless app is the only option.
Minute this app opens it is filled with glitches it can't read your location so just locks you out, try entering your post code and like magic you have entered it wrong... And don't try and edit it once this happens... It won't let you... It just refers you to the postcode page (which you are already on) this app is garbage.
"All fur and nae... underwear!! As we say in Edinburgh! Looks good but doesn't work! Buggy - the action and sound freeze or drop out altogether. 
As a result the programmes are impossible to watch! What's the point??? Only the ads work - surprise, surprise. Cheap and nasty - avoid!!!!"
doesn't let me view the shows because my 'area' is not available :(
"RUBBISH! 
Only lets you watch half the show you want to see then cuts out after the advert break, BUT, the adverts all work fine! 
This app has infuriated me today!  Absolute rubbish !"
Was working fine until three quarters of the way through Downton - then both the action and the sound went awry, meaning it fast-forwarded to a very poignant moment which didn't fit the sound! Am so annoyed, completely ruined my enjoyment of it...having said that, there were NO adverts during the programme. But I don't care now :-(
Too many adverts!! & sound with no picture
I was over the moon when I realised this was now an app, had been hoping for this for months, safe to say I was disappointed with it. Doesn't seem to run well after adverts. Really hope this gets fixed.
Too many adverts to start with. One star for the picture quality - when you actually get one!!! Screen goes black but only get the sound.
App is appallingly bad. Doesn't let you watch anything and constantly loses picture and gives only sound. Also loses connectivity frequently. Avoid at all costs. Doesn't even deserve 1 star
"1 stars being generous.
I stay in fife all the app finds for me to watch in my region is 3 programs"
Constantly freezing and crashing, or sound with no picture. It's a shame, I want to enjoy the app but it needs sorting out.
Crashes.
Waste of time. Crashed half way through programme on first use. Adverts are annoying.
Works great on 3G & wifi. Can watch all the main programmes very clear video stream. Free to watch but got ads in like on TV.
Seriously don't understand the bad reviews on here. Since the recent update especially I think the functionality is superb, fantastic quality, easy to use and I can watch all my favourite progs on my phone.
"First of all I only put 1 star because it doesn't let u go forward if you don't select any. Now lets talk about this crap app. 
First it doesn't play it keeps stopping even with wifi, if it loads atall. 
Rubbish app not worth the time downloading it."
Compared to the majority of similar apps this one works a treat. Has all the content I would expect and very easy to navigate.
This is pretty good, visuals are excellent on my IPhone and lots of up to date content. I like it a lot it is a great tool for catching up on things I have missed.
No problems whatsoever!
Rubbish keeps crashing.
Decent app, seems well made.  Streams are good quality and smooth, and its easy to navigate and find the programme you want to view.
Don't get the negative reviews - its ok and it doesn't me anything
The apps fine give it a chance. Negative views probably out of stv region. Come on "worst app I've ver bought" it's free!!! Get a life ;-)
I can stream everything perfect on ios6.....except this. All it does is play the ads, the shows play audio only....all visuals crash even when reset. Deleted.
Doesn't work. Only displaying 3 programs
Blurry when you can watch it and constantly crashes, waste of time!
Dreadful app how you actually watch a programme is a mystery you're left in a state of suspended animation wondering if something will happen, the entire app is dark and depressing I tried to get itv app but unfortunately it's not available where I live. The moment it is I'll dump this pile of cheese and download that app
This app is rubbish...it won't let me watch anything passed the first 10 secs. It crashes all the time and takes forever to load. DO NOT DOWNLOAD!!
"The worst app I've ever bought. Has crashed every time, then appears to have no videos at all! Absolutely useless, STV needs to get its act together. 
Terrible!"
Really disappointed with this app.  Sat through 3 ads then got halfway through opening credits to Downton Abbey and the app freezes, not letting be go back or anything.  Tried again and the same thing, oddly though the ads worked fine. Why not use some of the revenue from them to create a decent app that actually let's us watch what we want to see?
Complete waste of time, just doesn't work!
Can't watch anything without it crashing!
Keeps crashing.
This is so frustrating! It crashed constantly, doesn't do resume play when u try to get back into it and the time bar keeps disappearing so u can't get back to where u were. Really poor. I'm annoyed I'm stuck with this inferior app cos I'm in Scotland. STV is consistently rubbish!
Won't load up because of my location but changes when I move seat. Also can't skip forward in any program or pause it because the timeline bar isn't there
Worst app I've ever bought. Has crashed every time and then made me watch 3 adverts each time I start again which adds to the fury!
Working well now and free not £1.99 per previous reviewer.
First it tells me it's free then it says pay one ninety nine for single play crappy
It's crap as it keeps crashing and it always happens at the good bit you are watching!!
Crash , crash, crash, don't think I have watched a full program with out a crash
New version so much better. All of the initial issues resolved. Transmission dates makes it much easier to find the episode you missed too.
"Crashes a lot, having to start the programme again including all the adverts. You can't continue a programme later without re watching the adverts. 
Same 4 adverts all the time which renders them useless as I stop watching. 
Useful for catching up with shows but lagging behind other channels."
Tendency to crash on advert breaks and impossible to fast forward without it just showing a blank screen. Mine is an ipad 1 .. Seems better onmy girlfriend's ipad 2. For me useless if you can't actually warch an entire programme.
"I just want to watch the last segment of a programme that I missed this week. It just skips to the start after the advert break. 

Absolutely awful, truly glad I didn't spend money on it!"
Keeps crashing throughout programmes and doesn't resume the position of the show after you reload. Terrible.
You can't watch it cause It keeps stoping and starting and the screen goes black for ages so you need to start again.. The ads work perfectly though:)
"I downloaded this app to watch a drama I had missed. Even with ads it would have been under an hour. So far I've struggled for 3 hours and still can't get the final segment to play! It constantly pixilates, freezes and then the picture banishes and I'm left with a black screen and sound track. 
The ONLY things that play perfectly are the ads. That says it all! I'm word perfect on the ads, and have wasted my time as far as the programme goes! 
A complete shambles."
Keeps skipping back to the start of programmes, and when trying to scroll to where you were it either doesn't play or you have to watch all the adverts again.
"Great design and good use of AirPlay however, some major flaws.

Programs go back to the beginning after the incessant adverts have played - very irritating.
AirPlay cuts of when the iPad sleeps - need a revised build to ensure it doesn't sleep when using AirPlay

Overall not bad but not useful until these issue have been fixed!"
Glad that STV have now released the STV Player as an app. Just wish they'd produce more non ITV content.
Seemed good, lots of programs, doesnt crash.. Then try to watch x factor, it doesn't work!!! What?? Fix please!
only two programmes listed.  two.  only two programmes available on the entire app.  deleted.
Only has random scottish programmes, think it may be a a scottish tv app however in the description pictures it show programmes broadcasted in the uk but it didnt have then on the app.
Like Scottish parliament it is slow, pointless, needs updating and does not work outside of Scotland :-)
I live in England and it will only let me watch scottish proggrams even When i typed in my English postcode <f0><U+009F><U+0087><U+00AC><f0><U+009F><U+0087><U+00A7>
Nice job, plays perfectly well even on 3G...
Been waiting on this for a while
Addictive,easy to play, loads of fun. Love the graphics. You don't have annoying ads to put up with either. Great game.
Love the game but seriously why do I have to wait a day to complete quests so i can get more levels beyond 40?! Bored of waiting! Please sort it!
A very good and enjoyable game but some of the levels take ages to complete and you use all your lives over and over again........... LEVEL 50 Impossible without making purchases. It's over and out from me.......... <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0081><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0081><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0081>
Good fun, allot like other well known puzzle apps nothing really original though.
Enjoyable
Very addicting"
A very good and enjoyable game for the family
Since down loading this latest version so i can move on to more levels,im so disappointed. The app constantly crashes. I dont even get as far as making a single move before it happens. Iv sent a message to king to report the problem,but i just get a waste of time automated email back. Please can you bring another update out to fix this bug issue. Im not the only one having these problems
Really good game
Perfect corker to kill time
Interesting
Good
"I am sick and tired of clearing the last 'jelly' in this game to complete the level only  to find that 'otis' conveniently falls over and the level is lost.
'You only need one more jelly to win ?
Prove it - clear the banner and let us see for ourselves before closing the game."
Can't put it down!
Great game. Only one problem. I can't stop playing it. My wife is the same.
Great
Really good to past the time away
So addictive
Good
Loving it
Great for wasting time
"Love this game

Unlock new levels by playing quests is a great feature, love it"
Always good for a quick de-stress. It's annoying yet fun, and despite some levels seemingly impossible, with effort and luck, they can all be cracked. Thumbs up <f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008D>
I loved this game and was on level 469 but installed the latest update and the game crashes every time now, the app support  says has to be iPad 2, but like me you're probably reading this too late. Oh well at least I have a life now :-)
Very addictive.
Once again using original iPad latest update is causing game to crash on pressing play. As this has happened before you would think that someone would make sure it works well on all iPads? Very disappointing.
Great little toilet time game, got to level 101 but recently the game resets after use and I'm back to level one. They should take some of their advertisement funds and sort out the games first as I'm now looking for something else.
Thoroughly enjoyed this game until I opened it today and it had reset to level one. I was nearly at level 400! Livid.
Since the latest updates it keeps crashing. Don't waste your money on this rubbish until it gets sorted. Maybe when the number of 1 stars (you can't give 0 stars) exceeds the 5 stars King will do something. In the meantime their customer service stinks.
Highly Addictive and gets you in trouble if you do it all the time.....
Just finished 710 but it won't let me ask friends for tickets to get through the next station have tried for hours gggggggrrrrrrrrr
I am totally fed up. Since October update my game WILL NOT load!!!  I love this game and I'm on level 525 now with this problem I'm getting no further. I have written to support team since 5th November but so far I haven't heard back from them ! Pleeeeeese can someone do SOMETHING !!
Can't get enough!!
Fun game with the easy and difficult levels
Good game more lives would help please
A good game when not stuck on the same level for 5 months. Tried day after day to pass 201. Did it one day with 13 moved left. Unbelievable. Should make it easier on the really hard ones as how am I expected to get to 200 let alone 725
Great fun but I don't like waiting for ages for new lives, I don't have Facebook so I can't share lives either
Great game, very fun and addictive and keeps on changing so you can keep on playing
ah well there's worse habits ;-0
Fantastic time taker

I get through to 275, and then it all packs up. Was has happened.
Love it
Totally addictive!!!
Incredibly addictive and frustrating but great!
Started playing and was enjoying it, next thing I know I'm back to level 1! Wtf!
Used to enjoy this game but since the last update it crashes every time without fail, sort this out or I will delete it!
Brill game love it
<f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008D>
Very good I really like it
A truly addictive experience !! (in a good way)
Irritating but addictive!!
Great fun
Addictive
What's the point of updates when they just make the game crash!!!!!   This had happened and another King game.   Get a grip and make updates updates and not downgrades.
Awesome game bro
I am really enjoying challenging myself to solve each level of the game. Some days I use it just to switch of and play. It's great to beat your friends.
This update will, if not fixed soon, will be the deletion of CCS for good. These updates should be tried, tested & verified prior to release. This is bad crack King! Get it fixed urgently!!
Is there a problem with level 621 on the ipad ? Watching how to play this level on You Tube there   are candies in the jelly which help to break the jelly up , but when i play this level the jellies are all clear so you just have to hope striped candies clear it or the frog ! Please help Candy Crush . Is this a problem ?
"This game is so good it's so addictive and I am tired of people saying its a piece of crap if they hate it so much why don't u just delete it don't just post comments on how crap it is cause no one cares what u say and p.s ur a piece of crap if u post hate comments so stop posting hate comments there is no need 
For moaning about it so shut your bloody mouth u should only post reviews if they are friendly  ."
Cannot get level 576 to start. Keeps crashing. Rather disappointed. Will just need to play 2048.
"Once again another update and nothing but hassle.  Ok my Ipad is the original one but this game still says it's compatible however new updates never work correctly.

Now i can sign in to face book, play the wheel and see my progress but everytime i hit the play level button it kicks me out. Tried emailing King and got a rubbish automated response. I do know how to clear Cache and reboot my ipad thank you, its the game not my ipad !!!"
Great game
Addictive
Constantly crashing, haven't been able to play since last update. Do you not test before putting live!! Not happy. Pls pls fix bugs when it's convenient, would be much appreciated
Very addictive
Brilliant game, great way to pass time
I really do enjoy this game except when you get stuck on a level and it takes months to get past. It would be good if they offered a "skip level" or simplify option to stop people getting bored. Otherwise I really enjoy it :)
But a lot down to pure luck
I love this game. It is fun and addictive at the same time. My whole family are hocked. I love this game because you get a new challenge each level and you aren't repeating yourself. 100% recommend this to anyone! :)
Got to level 191 and then for no reason reverted back to level 1. Tried everything to recover but no luck. Hugely frustrating. King have no customer services and there's no online help. Rubbish!
What a fabulous game, I've had hours of fun with it.  Thoroughly recommend it.
"Since doing latest update on the 6th can't get the app to play starts to load then just crashes.
Rubbish"
GREAT APP!!
Can't stop playing it... Love it!
Brill game can't stop playing
Love this game
This is a great game
Too much!
Guyu
Highly addictive great for passing time away, shouldn't have to wait to unblock levels!!
Good game
Download this game at your peril, totally addictive but great fun.
Great except having to wait 3 days until I can pass to the next world
All hard work gone down the drain. From level 219 to level 1. Will never play again.
Great game
A pleasurable addictive game a must have.
Love it but annoying at times
A game designed to force you to keep buying more credits.
Such an addictive game. But can be annoying when stuck on a level.
Hours of mind numbing frustration getting through the hundreds of levels, but can not put it down for long!
"Since update lost all progress....so in return it will be deleted along with all their other apps. Shouldn't even have one star!

Update. Levels returned for 24hrs then gone again...well now my patience has as well. Adios King games from all devices in our household"
Beware you WILL get addicted.
Addicted ! ! !
Keeps crashing since last update, usually just after I've started a game so I then lose a life. By the time it sorts itself out I've usually only got 2 lives left.  A note on comments about purchases on other reviews...I've managed to get to level 430 without spending anything.  Admittedly I frequently get stuck on certain levels for weeks at a time...
Used to love this game, but have now been stuck on the same level for about 3 months, and therefore will probably be deleted soon. Would be good to have a 'skip' option if you've had over so many attempts.
Been playing this for a year on my IPad, got to level 181 and it won't let me go any further. I press on play and it takes me straight back to apps page! On verge of deleting, so annoying!
Superb
Addictive
Love it
Its fun until you run out of lives. Like the unlimited lives perk tho
Need to provide better support to iOS 6 devices, as soon as the home screen loads up. It crashes!
good
Can be fun sometimes but at other times it can be near impossible to progress. Very addictive
A great way to kill time
Love this game <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0080>
Ta alott
Love this game so much it's dangerous! Lol
See title
Watch it people all they want is your credit card numbers. Another con to get our money. They leave you stuck on a level so you top buy items to get past it. Waste of time and boring now
Time consuming app but ok
Crashes every time since November 2014 update. Can see progress but as soon as I try to enter a level it boots me out. No reply from app support other than an auto generated response which is irrelevant and no help
Enjoy playing it, can be quite addictive!
Since the new update the game keeps crashing<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00AC>
Download now
Brilliant App - although had to start again after getting to level 135 after I lost my phone - gutted. Am on level 70 within a week and it's just so addictive that I can't stop playing it! It's costly though as some levels you just couldn't finish without buying in-app purchases.
Love love love this game, can't wait for my lives to refill
As addictive as crack cocaine
Gets boring when you can't get pass the level
Addictive game.
;)
The title says it all. Play every day....great game
Wow
Such an amazing game! It's fun but very time consuming lol. One thing I'd improve is the time for the lives. It takes 30 mins for one life
Absolutely love this game.
I love it!!
Brilliant fun
Too addictive but fun especially with friends
Sweet!!!!!
Yuck ivudydfifucuvivi
Keeps u busy when u are bored and it's free A++
I really like this game but after the most recent update it does nothing but crash on me. Please sort this out!!
Good game, but wish I didn't like it
It's good & hard
Great fun
Can no longer play this as it always crashed on my iPod touch. Mail lies the help line but no reply. Had to delete it now.
Great addictive game
Unable to play since last update - crashes constantly. Needs an urgent fix
Lots of fun
Goooood game
After the latest update I cannot even play every time I go to start the game it just keeps crashing not good as I play this game all the time and love it please can you sort it out -:)
Very addictive! <f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008D>
Awesome
It's great and really addictive!
Great
Fantastic
A very good game.
It's the same on every level, repetitively boring, highly addictive, and if you can't get pass a specific level after you have lost a few lives, the game seems to know and makes it easier for you!, I only play it for free, have not spent any money on it and don't intend to, I just wait for my lives to reboot!
Love this game, so pleased there's only 5 lives otherwise I'd never do anything else
Really enjoying it.
Soooo addictive!
It's not too bad can be really challenging at times but I enjoy a challenge now and again.
I did start to enjoy this and there was a certain amount of determination to get to the top and beat your friends but after a while realising that it's computer controlled and no chance of winning without buying or computer letting you win.  Just like everyone else loosing hope may stop playing after 2 months of being stuck at level 140.  Don't like being brain washed by a piece of software !
Brill
Up to level 678 and now it won't even let me play!! Poor update and needs fixing!!!!!!
Candy crush is the best game I've ever had its addictive, fun and amazing. It has loads of levels to get through and lots of different power ups and I really like this game in my opinion it is absolutely amazing so take this information and download this game, I can believe it's free!<f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008F>
Excellent game once you start you won't want to stop <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0080>

"Last update lost all my progress. Deleting. 
Try to leave a bad review and ""that nickname is taken"". Poor."

Love it ...
Fantastic game
#funtimes
From 400 to 1. Fantastic.
Such a good game so addictive
I too have been put back to level 1after finally completing level 97, please restore the game as it is brilliant.
Game crashes before fully opening so now completely unplayable
Come on get this sorted game will not even load without crashing
Love this game so much fun :)
What a great game and free too
Top game
The game will literally force you to purchase to progress - this is more for those who have money to spare if they want to.
Addictive as hell can't get enough of this
Hours of fun and very addicted - the longest standing game in my phone
Amazing and complete fun pack.
Great game
...and still as addictive as ever. Love it!
Awesome game very addictive
We all play it for fun.
Love the game really addictive
Brill game
As title
It's the best! Got a jackpot I did!
Really enjoyable game could play it for hours on end
Only on the early one hundred levels but already realised this game is based mainly on luck and skill!! However, it is highly addictive, fun and irritating all rolled into one, as I progress onto the next levels, extras will have to be bought and when it comes to that then that is the day I stop playing as it then just becomes a con!! Also, that owl is the most frustrating bird on the planet:) All in all, this game is good fun!!
Very enjoyable but addictive
Like the game
Very helpful when I thought I lost all my progress love this game :)
This app is amazing, love It so much
Horribly addictive
Defo a game keeps your mind working lol
ADDICTIVE
Only downside is the cost incurred if you're to on Facebook-but love the 2 hours play I get when I do unlock the next area.
Great game
Great game
Since the update can not even play on my iPad now, please please fix this bug :(

What the hell is going on with candy crush. Updated the app and now I have lost all progress. This is the second time that this has happened to me now. What the hell is going on????? Tried to go through tech support and it's all gibberish!!!!!! Come on now!!!!
The recent update worked fine until today where I went from level 266 (or similar) to level 1, which is obviously quite annoying.
Classic colour matching fun
Good game, ideal when killing time or when sitting on the loo!
Never seen it ! Fix !! Good game though
Awesome!!
Should be re-named Candy Crash Saga. Last two updates have caused this on iPod. Very disappointing.
Very addictive game
Kakxbxmxl. Shamans jsbsksnsbzjxbbznxkx
Had been addicted to this frustrating game for a while but now play to pass time with mindset that every lost game takes me closer to the one I win.  Less frustrating that way and more fun again.
Extremely addictive!!! Was getting really fed up waiting for lives until I realised that if I set my phone a day ahead on the calendar you automatically get another 5 lives straight away. You can do this as many times as you want! Certainly beats having to wait about :)
Installed the new update only to have my progress lost! Rubbish!!!!

I don't want to spend money to have fun on my iPhone!
Just updated and now can't play game at all. Please fix as soon as possible
Like it
I think this game is amazing! It's my fave game at the moment. Some of my friends don't like it that much but I think that it's defiantly worth getting. Quite addictive but good fun. You have to get it!
Epic
I have recently downloaded the latest update to my iPad and it consistently crashes whilst booting. If I wrote software remotely as bad as that I would be unemployable.
Love it
I like this game
Still enjoyable even for old men like me (58 years old).
Can't believe the recent update has reset it back to level 1!!!! Very unhappy!
Love it!
Great game. Very addictive but very slow to load up on my iphone 4s
Did get up to 400+ but changed email and now back at start for third time so not impressed
Loving this game!
I have thoroughly enjoy this masterpiece so much so I have become an addict! I have it on all my devices do as I am down on one I pick it ip on another. Well done!
Brilliant game!
I love this but my other half hates it as it steals so much of my attention!
Love this game,so total addictive. Do wish that some levels don't just need luck to complete.
Yes
Super game app
Rty
Hooked !!
Give us more lives and i want the jackpot is it possible other then that good game
Highly addictive!!!!
Not even worth it anymore, got to 236 and the game got wiped and it won't let me on to the next level. What was the point in updating! The constant other games advert is also ridiculous!
Helps being bored and long journeys
It's so addictive
Good fun and very addictive
Couldn't believe it. Lost all data and went back to level one after the last update. Rubbish.
I put it down for months but keep coming back
So annoyed that it took me back to level 1 been playing for months. You need to fix this problem as it has happened to so many people. Really upset and I feel like I cannot play this app again...
Am glad you have sorted out the Daily Wheel spin and I don't have to join Facebook
Addictive, if you have an addictive personality then you will be very addicted....
Nice
Really addictive!!!
Totally addictive! I love it!
Amazingly great fun. A must app <f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+00B8>
I luv this game so much but I have to say it keeps on getting better and better. Keep up the good work King
Unable to play. Game crashes straight away
It's a cute addictive game but having to pay to get from one level to the other is too cheeky.
Just can't get off this game !!! Help !! <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0080>
Can't wait for the new game. Loving candy crush
This is a highly additive game it just keep u wanting more!! Great time filler too... Never seem to get the jackpot on the free daily spin Tho!! <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+009E>
Great game, very addictive <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0080>
I really like this game and recently updated it. Since then I have not been able to even get on a level before it crashes. It is very annoying. If this does not get fixed then I will be deleting it.
Since upgrade keeps crashing for no reason can't send life's or other things what the hell pls fix it sick of wasting things I've built up coz it's crashed I can't even get on the game now either
Love, love, love <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0081>

What more is there to say!!
Great! Thoroughly enjoy this to relax!
Love it.
Very addictive will give you hours of fun.
Addictive! Love it
"Honestly, how can King release an update 
that wipes out your progress? Presume they
are focussed on profit given their recent 
press releases and not on providing a good
game experience."
I played it and it annoyed me. So much so I took about a year off playing. I managed to complete the level I was stuck on and I'm flying through he levels and addicted again. Good stuff!!
There's one main word to describe this game... ADDICTING! This game is a must have!
I Love This Game Soo Much<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0082>

Level 735 is impossible.... I enjoy at challenge but this is too hard :-(

Like other reviewers, I have lost all progress and been sent back to level one. It's time to delete this game....
Automatically update yesterday, played it today to find I am back to level 1! Months worth of playing wiped out.... Guess how I'm feeling right now!
Love the game but since the last update the game is constantly crashing taking a life with it each time! So frustrating and irritating. Please, please, please GET IT SORTED
A+++
Love this keeps me amused for hours
Come on King sort it out. Candy Crush and now Bubble Witch are both crashing after this up date. Every time, getting ready to delete all King apps. Seriously peed off.
Game will no longer load since last update.  Please fix this.
Will not load to my ipod crashes and goes back to my homescreen , hope the next update will help !!!
Brill game apart from how much stuff you get tried and sold
Since last update, crashes every time I try to play.  Please sort it out.

"Very addictive, but I do get caught up spending money !! As I get so frustrated waiting !!!

Never win jackpot, I'm sure it's fixed as it slows down or speeds past x also keep crashing"
Gd lol
Good game, but lately crashes before I can even play. If not fixed, then obviously will stop playing.
Love this game but latest update has taken me back to level 1. Rubbish.
Not happy did update and now can not play the game please sort this out
So far I'm enjoying the game. Great game on iPhone and iPad. Much fun is being had!!
It is good
Great
So addictive!!! Determined to get to the end but think it's going to take a while lol
After the recent candy crush update I have been having a lot of issues with not being able to play I usually can't even get as far as opening a level without the game crashing and if I do I lose a life when I haven't even had the chance to start the game.
Check it out
Does job
Great game !!
Very addictive
ADDICTIVE!!! <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00AC><U+2764><U+FE0F>
Caution!! : most addictive !!
Addictive and brilliant
Very addictive.
Enjoy it on occasions. Great to have to get to sleep to. New update was bad. I get fed up and bored when the levels get too hard or I have spent too long on them.
Amazeballs app. Whata game
Can't put it down!  Just too good.
"Great game. Have managed to get to level 700+ 
now since the last update it no longer loads.
Might actually get some work done now I can't spend my time playing this.."
Sweet
Really nice game very enjoyed so far can't wait to play
Great game wud tell all my mates
"Feeling cheated......I'd got up to level 98....I've paid money to play this game and get through some of the levels.
Today I go to play and everything I've done has been lost!! It's back at level one!!! 
Not sure what's gone on! :-("
I was on level 249... Update yesterday sends me back to level one. No way I'm doing all that again... Lost a customer. Well done King.
It's the most amazing addicted game
Brill game. You'll lose track of time as it's so addictive. Best puzzle game ever
Completely addictive

Great for passing time - very enjoyable and frustrating at the same time
Gh
Has anyone actually won the jackpot on the spinwheel? P.s I'm only doing this for the free colour bomb reward
What a game!
Love this game!! Always something different for every level it's not boring or repetitive ,it is rather addicting!!
I love it more and more
Addictive, absorbing, harmless amusement, a great challenge
Latest update crashes before game gets started. Did anyone bother to test the new version before releasing it???
This game I love but since update cannot play on my I pad it just crashes continually. This issue needs addressed now or you will loose loyal customers
"Crashing constantly since new iPad update.  More annoying than ever
Need more time at end of levels to register scores before deciding how to proceed
Difficult to get a response to queries, automated responses are a waste of time, they can't be replied to and don't answer the question
Get yourself sorted!"
Back to level 1 and the restore purchases button seems to have gone walkers. Great you've updated it, really annoyed I have to start again, for the umpteenth time!
Totes amazeballs love this game, very addictive
Gghgf
Since latest update unable to connect to store!
Enjoy it totally
Latest update means game now crashes all the time :-( pls fix as I'm missing my daily dose of Candy Crush!!
Can't give you ZERO, but thanks to new update I've lost everything and game wants me to start all again! Not happy at all!!!
Was a great game but now can't play at all just crashes all the time
Since the Nov 6th update, game crashes on loading every time, unable to play at all. Please get this sorted.
Did they even test this update???!!!
Excellent & addictive!!
Great game but can't put my phone down!
"Your latest update has caused more bugs than it fixed! Can't even play the game now as every time I try it just crashes on my iPod !

Hurry up and sort it out please!"
Great game, but updated today and now I can't play it!!!  Please sort this out. I need my candy crush fix!!!!!!!
"Need my fix every day!
Cute, colourful, annoying, I simply love it!!"
Gg
Spot on
"I'm on level 400+ so I must enjoy this app. Some of the levels are totally dependent on luck and you have to just play and play and play until the right combination of pieces comes up to allow you to complete it, which is really irritating.

I'm getting really fed up with all the constant badgering about other games too."
Very good game keeps u wanting to play more and more some levels can be very challenging A++ for this game :)
great game
Very addictive.
"Just updated. All my levels are gone im back to 0 

GUTTED <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00AD> deleting it now i cant go through it again."
Great game worth the space on your phone
Such a brilliant game, so addictive
Pukka game
Level 609 and 619 are the same :/ seems stupid... Another new update but still can't play via my iPhone as it only goes up to level 725 and I'm already on the next episode on the computer!... By the time the next update comes I'm sure I will once again be further ahead! Update the app so it has all the levels the computer has! Or what's the point in it? I keep saying the same thing every update I'm just infront it's terribly frustrating as all of my wheel spin bonuses are on my phone and I can't use them :( may as well delete the phone app because it's no good to me at all really!
'Nuff said.
Can't connect to Facebook since new update. Please sort this then u can have 5 stars again
Once again, an update is causing the game to crash - very annoying (understatement!), especially as I've just progressed to the next section of the game.  Every time I try and open the level, it just crashes.  Please sort this out!!!
On a really high level, so hence really enjoy this game, done the new update, now all it does is crash as soon as you get in to the menu...sort it out pleaseeeeeeeeeeeee
Great
Addictive and a whole lot of fun, but beware, buying gold bars can run away with you before you know it!
I enjoy it although some are a little too frustrating. it is supposed to FUN which is questionable at times. keep thinking it is time to pack in. Sandra's
Great fun
"I'm sufficiently irritated with this game to write my first review of an app., and for all the wrong reasons. 

Updated the app. the other week, and for some bizarre reason lost all progress. I wrote a complaint via the King website, and got some crap, irrelevant copypasta in reply. Oddly, however, my progress was restored... for a day. Played a level this morning, passed it, only to find myself booted back to level 1 again. So now it's being deleted. Screw you, you greedy w**kers, with your in-app. purchases for every little thing, and your conveniently timed losses of progress/lives/gold bars/etc."
just updated antomatically!but all my data is lost!I have to start from the very beginning! Please fix this ASAP!
New update keeps crashing, can't play now, disappointed!!!
Downloaded latest update - was up in the 400s but has taken me back to level one.
A lot of fun, seriously.
Its so cool, whenever i got time i just crush some candy :D
The game did work fine until this last update. It now doesn't connect to facebook, so I reinstalled it as recommended now I'm back at level 1 and all purchases lost and it still doesn't work. So annoyed with king.com as no help at all!
What a game download a must
Used to be all time favourite but it's cruel how hard some levels are then so much easier ones thrown in for a teaser.
After 225 levels ! Your last update wiped memory and restarted at level 1 !!!! Please restore or it's goodbye Candy Crush and associated Apps <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00AA>
After latest update I'm back at level 1 !!!!
Candy crush is the best
Why has this new version taken me back to level 1? How is this either fair or good practice?
Highly addictive game. Play it on my phone as well as my tablet (get 10 lives instead of 5). Some levels can be very tricky and take ages to do, and the new odus game can leave you very frustrated, but I love it! Only reason why it has 4 stars not 5 is the number of lives you get on the free version. Would like more.
After downloading the update all my memory has been wiped and now have to start at level 1!!!!!!
Does not start on Ipad 1 - no useful response from King's customer services. Compatibility listing is inaccurate,. Total pain...
After months of getting to level 474... (I know it's not that far) I update the game and go back to find I'm at level 1... I can't believe it.. furious :(
Really good game
Very good game
Very good and addictive game, but I just completed level 201 and for no reason Im back on LEVEL1 <U+2757><U+FE0F>Lost all my extras lost everything. Not happy!
I'm disappointed, the game is good but since my last two updates it keeps crashing on my IPAD 1.
It will no longer connect to Facebook.
1 star because I can't give none!! I had reached level 530 something - absolutely addicted but after doing yesterday's update I have been sent back to level 1 and surprisingly the data of my gold bars remained the same - it didn't reset it to the 50 I started off with! I will NOT be playing again unless you can miraculously get me back to the level I was on. GOODBYE! <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1>
Annoyingly addictive
Coooooool
Brilliant game
Addictive!
I updated the app last night and this morning I opened it to see that I had been put back to the start! 3 months of my life wasted!!!!!!
Today's update has totally messed up the connection to Facebook. I've tried everything I can think of to resolve it but it seems like it is the update.  King Games should really work on this as it's a recurring issue according to the forums. Thank goodness I have a life to keep me busy instead of playing CCS!
A1
Good
I love this game <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0083>
I spend so much time on this game it's unreal, but I love it
Your last update is so bad, every time I try to play any level....crash. This isn't the first time, it seems ever over update just screws up the game. I stopped spending money on this crap ages ago. Don't bother downloading this unless you like watching loading screens and new ingame adds.
I have lost all my levels after latest update, all 400+ levelz3 hour train journey everyday and more set of life's can be a bonus but I'm not wasting my money or resetting my time on my phone just to get another set of crappy rounds!
Totally addictive game. Love the levels without the bombs. Keep adding more levels please.
Experiencing a lot of crashing on IPod 4th gen during loading, but also mid-game now, very frustrating.
Cool
Much happier now that app developer King have removed linking to a facebook account a condition of its bonus wheel.
Can't connect to FB on any of the King games. Lost lives and gold bars I purchased on bubble witch and all spare lives on candy crush and farm heroes. Please sort it asap.
Love it addicted to it
Lol
Cool
Good fun
I have to say that this game started out ok but when the stupid Odus bird game started it went down hill fast! That bird falls off the moon to easily I've notice when I'm winning the game the random candys that fall tip him off the moon and its game over!  Don't waste your time it's a con!
Very addictive, good fun!
I was on a very high level . Then one day I was just play it and it took me of that level and took me to the very begging and deleted all scores. Not very happy at all<f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008E><f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008E><f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008E>
Love it
Enjoyable, frustrating and very addictive
Awesome
Yeah - great game, lots of fun. Careful of the in-app purchases.
It's a great game though can get very addictive. But limiting the number of lives you have help but frustrating when you run out and have to wait. Find it's 50% strategy and thinking about moves and 50% pure luck.
"I really enjoy playing this game. 
My grandson loves to get on here and play also."
"This game is addictive. Love the colors.
Have it on my iPad & iPhone."
Still love it after all this time.
Fun helps me kill time
"How can they get away with making levels so hard to finish that they aren't any fun anymore? 

How come level 717 starts with 1 color bomb for me and I see other videos where people start with 3 color bombs? This level is inconceivable."
Four times reloading after getting a good distance then crash each time.  Now cannot even get to no.1 without crashing.  Used to be a fun game, now just a lesson in futility.
I LOVE this game!!! Can't get enough of it!
Haha I'm bored
Hours of fun!!!

I was at level 351 and with this new update sent me all the way back to 1! What the heck is going on! I don't even want to play anymore if I have to try to work clear back to where I was. That took forever! King please help!
Can't stop playing!
I like all the graphics and different games available. I also like the variety of puzzles!
Great game actually addicting
I'm addicted to this game
"Ever since the most recent update, I can not play.  I have sent emails to support, but get no response.

However, each time I try to play, I lose another player.

Have you now built in a ""bug"" that now gets  us players that don't spend money to play?

Don't get greedy, King games will a bad rep real fast!

Looking forward to a quick fix on this new ""bug""!"
I enjoy this game
Im addicted
It's a great game!
Honestly the game is really fun and addictive and I would certainly give it five stars, but I'm tired of getting set back to level one. It has happened more than once now, so please fix.
After being over level 300, now all of the sudden I'm back to level 1. Add my name to the list that this has happened to, I'm not starting all over. This better get fixed.
I am really upset with candy crush. I went on the app today and all of my progress was lost. I loved to play and I was around level 90 and level 30 with Otis. It was previously working and when I went on it today it stated me back at level one. Thanks a lot King.
After the most recent update Candy Crush no longer works on my iPad.  It starts to load the current level and then immediately exits the App.  I am disappointed that I can no longer play the game.  It was one of my favorites.
i suddenly don't like this game anymore!! i go into the game to pass level 89(i was originally on level 140 but i deleted and game and downloaded it again) and it set me back to level 1!!!<f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008E><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00B1> how dare they lose my progress!! until this problem is fixed, im avoiding this game at all costs!
Love the game, even on levels that frustrate me
I love this game and have gotten pretty far without spending anything. Since the latest bug fix in November, I keep crashing and losing lives. I have done all the resetting, etc. that I know to do. Still crashes all the time. Any suggestions?
Best game ever
Game is great and all but I've got a problem. I was at level 70 and I exited out of the game. A few days later I got back on and it had moved me all the way back to level one and had taken away all of my levels on everything. I'm not sure why or how but I would like it fixed
Awesome game
Everytime i exit out of the app or it crashed, IT RESETS ME BACK TO LVL 1!!!!! It has done this 3 times! Im so done i wouldn't recommend this app to anyone because of this
"Would love to play more than 5 games at a time.  Gets to be frustrating when it pops up, out of lives.

Love this game but since the last update everything has gone hay wire.  Every time I get into it it all of a sudden shuts me down and I lose lives because of it.  Fix the problem!!!  I don't want to say ill never play candy crush again.  I love it too much."
Can't stop playing
I have fun with the game, but would prefer a game that didn't require money to keep playing outside of the narrow time limits.
The game takes me back to level one. I was on 38 and it took me bam to level 1. Please fi
"I was loving candy crush - UNTIL I got to level 50. I've been stuck on this level for several weeks now even though I've gotten candy crush at least 3 times. Each time I complete candy crush it shows I'm still only on the first star (need 3 stars to progress to the next level).  Please help as I'm about to delete this app for my sanity sake!!

Update: yay!! I received a pass to the next level. Thank you for your mercy candy crush!"
Been playing and have not stop yet
Best game ever.
Fun if you have the time. I have rarely had issues on iPhone app. Easier to get thru hard levels on Facebook computer version.  Yes, you can still progress without gold or buying moves/bonus items. It does help to have friends who send lives and extra moves.

Levels decently challenging
Cucucigicioviv
Fun game but very expensive to use all of the features.
Good game but I wish you can  spin the wheel more than once a day
Addicted!!! Time killer.
I love this game even though it frustrates me quite often when I can't complete a level. I look up the cheats for that level and keep plugging away and eventually get it. Lots of great fun.
Make level 713 easer cause I can't pass it!!!!!
LOVE this game...
This game is addictive !!!!
Prices for extras is outrageous. Takes forever for friends to let give you a ticket to the next level and I lose interest when too hard.
I enjoy the game and appreciate how we interact with our friends. KMT
Love this game! So much fun.
Music needs to go, but very fun to play!
Es divertido buen juego!
Can stop playing
Good game no problems
As above
Candy crashs after recent update. And the game begins from the first level. It dumped all my progress.
Great game. Easy for people that don't have great hand eye coordination.
Very addictive game!!!
I am very addicted to this game but this last update does nothing but crash. I am very sad and hope it gets fixed soon. It won't let me play but it takes a life and then crashes.
I love candy crush my friend got me hooked on it and she started to come over so that we could play together. Candy crush is the best freakin game ever. It's really addicting and it makes a lot of money.
At first I played it out of boredom ... it can be very addicting.
Mother of all Skinner Box traps.
Good
It's ok
Great game
Lots of fun for those with a relentless pursuit!
Great game and very addictive.
Fun game
So sick
Fun to play and constantly challenging on many levels.
I ADORE YOU
Good
Great game and addicting!
I love this game. Makes the time fly by.
The best!
Addicting
Excellent
Love the game but the farther I go the more expensive it gets since some levels force you to spend money to proceed.  It's getting prohibitive!  I am considering deleting it but I'm addicted!
I hate games in the App Store but I'm so addicted ever since this game came along. To whomever created candy crush , your awesome!!!
-
It's the best game I ever played, please add some gold in every episode :P
Love this game! No problems with it whatsoever and it works perfectly fine on my phone.
Addictive :)
Can't stop playing...
Best match up style game on market. Either try it or don't, don't waste time reading about such a popular game.
Took me a yea but I beat the level I was stuck on woohoo
I like that game it's very instresting specially when I am stuck on a level my god so I wait for full life than play again to complete level

Awesome game, very addicting.
Love this addicting game.
Good
Like the title says....addicting
Love to play.
I am so totally addicted to this game!!!
Game crashes every time I try to access my current level. This began with the latest upgrade.
But it gets a 3 for resetting back to level 1 when I synced it to Facebook. I was on level 625. Had to start all over.
Enjoyably
Awesome game totally love it
I love this soooooo much!! Fun fun fun!!
Since the most recent update I can no longer play the game.  I can open it, I spin for a bonus, but every time I select my level to play, it crashes.  Super frustrated.  Fix, please!!!
Very fun and addictive as everyone should know!!!!
Very addictive....can't stop playing
I have not stopped playing this game. It is awesome
I'm in love with this game :)
Excellent game! No problems so far!
One of the best games I've played next to bejeweled blitz!!
Goodie!!!
I was on level 400 and now I'm on level 1. Why is this happening? No one wants to start over after putting that much time into this game. And it won't connect to facebook at all. Come on now get it together here.
Loved the game until yesterday when I made the mistake of installing the latest update. Can no longer play on my iPad....crashes every time I try to log in.
I love this sweet fun filled games. Every level is a sweet challenge.
Addicted!
When is this game going to be playable on iPhone 6?  I just bought my new iPhone today (upgraded from iPhone 4) and was bummed to see that the game didn't load correctly. Please hurry up and fix this!!
King games should be ashamed of themselves
This game is infuriatingly addictive.
Love the game, but hate when you get a bonus on the spin wheel and nothing shows up on the game.  Bugs!?
I'm addicted
Fun, simple concept yet difficult levels hold your interest
Addicting!
Love.. Love.. Love. Super challenging.
Since the last update, I haven't been able to play the game.  It loads but then when I hit the play it shuts down.  Total crash.  Very disappointing because I love the game.  Please fix it soon!
I like the game- I do not like that I must continuously bother my fave food friends- it makes me not want to play.
It's a very fun and addictive game.
Love this version.
I am very disappointed that I am on level 40 and I can no longer get the game to come up after I get to the play label. My screen goes blank and goes to the candy crush icon. Can this problem be solved?
It's addictive
So today I go to play candy crush on my iPad and when it loaded it started from level 1 like I had never played before. I was on level 167 before the crash. Very disappointing
It's ok pretty much the same puzzle game as ther rest
It is a great game. Congratulations
This is a great game
I've been very addicted to this game for 2 years. I've never paid anything but it's definitely taken me a long time to finish certain levels. I play whenever I'm watching tv or just relaxing. I like this I don't have to concentrate to hard on it.
"Love this game 
One of the things i am addicted to 
Each level is a challenge"
When I downloaded Candy Crush, I played with it constantly. But about a year later, it gets pretty boring and now I don't play with it anymore because it is very boring when you play with it constantly. Tip: Only play a few levels a day, the less you play with it, the more interesting it gets.
I opened the app today to find that I was reset back to level 1 after playing this game for months. Pretty crappy thing to happen. Good bye to you candy crush.
Wonderfully addicting.
Great game
Have not spent any money, and lots of lives. I do get stuck some times but if I pay attention I will win
Fun game, but I hate that you have to wait to get to the next level.
This game never gets old!
Overly addictive!!
Sooo addictive, though!
An awesome additive and fun game!!!! Good to keep your mind active too.
Love this game! I'm so addicted!
Very fun and addicting. Run away as fast as you can.
One of the best games ever on iPhone
Not sure what I can add to the world of reviews out there.  Went back to this game after about a year and it's still fun.
Love this game
Love it
Great game!  I am a fan and addicted!!
good app
Uh huh
Awesome game to get your mind off of things.  Very addictive!
I resisted playing this game for the longest time but then I finally gave in and I totally love it!!!! Excellent!!!
IM HOOKED LOL
Been stuck on on stuck on level 70 for 3 months I've spent my actual money to try and beat the level and every time it was one jelly to break every time so yeah I'm done.
Never gets old!
Love playing this game everyday!!!!
Very addicting!!!!!
Love it!
Awesome
I love this game but I would be on a real high level and I would come back on the gambit would start me over at level 1 again!!!!! This is so frustrating in about to delete it. Please fix!!!!!
Have not been able to play since the latest update. Game loads,but when I tap play,it immediately shuts down. Hopefully you will fix this with next update! Very frustrating!
Cool
Very addicting game love it!
I enjoy this game
So addicting!!!
Love this game but can be expensive. I don't buy I just wait!
Good
I loooove loooove loooove the game get stuck some times but the I finally beat it!
I wish the lives on my game didn't exist bc I won't be able to play for a long time bc I changed my time on my phone. And now I have to wait months before I can play. Please cancel the time
Es terapia anti stress!
If not for candy crush I would had heart attack. It keeps me busy and make me feel comfortable. I love it!!!
Addicting that owl pisses me off though.
This game has been fun but now it's a huge headache. I have been stuck on Level 735 for entirely too long. This level is impossible to pass!  It's gonna take a whole lot of luck to pass it or spend all your money on boosters and that is NOT gonna happen!  I never complain but this riDICULOUS!!!  I'm pretty much done with this game until they fix this. Just STUPID!  It's supposed to be fun...it's no longer fun!
Great gamee !!!
After latest update, game has been crashing repeatedly and erased all of my progress, sending me back to the beginning!
"best game ever!!
very challenging!!"
Ever since your last update I cannot get the game to work. It starts to open and then crashes. Please fix this!! I miss playing!
Good times!!
I love this game but it's frustrating my dad plays it for me sometimes but I love the game! It's fun and unique! You should get the game!
Awesome game!
Hard to put down. Great game.
So addictive! Hard to put down!!<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0083><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0083>
Great game
Love it
A fun game to play when I have free time.
This game always gets you thinking that you're never going to get to the next level. Yet when you do (2 months later) you fall down on your knees thanking the good Lord. In other words a very addicting game y'all must play it.
leave this game for cookie jam, it's way better and I didn't erase my data after completing ALL levels <f0><U+009F><U+0092><U+00A9>
Using an iPod touch 4th generation, the game crashes when it attempts to load any level. It is on iOS 6.1.6. Help!!
TONS OF FUN!!!
Play on...so much fun!
Best way to relax! Love this game
i love it
I have fun playing this everyday
Awesome game. Highly addictive
Good game for time killing !
I've only been playing a couple of months now and I'm hooked.  Great game
With the last upgrade, I can't get the game to load so I can play. Keeps crashing. Pleas fix!
I like this game it gets very addicting and eats up time in class
Yeeahhh boiiiiiii!!!!!!!
Awesome! Skill game.
Yaaaaassssssss
It's fixed and working now.
Great game but since the iOS update the game crashes often and the app goes into slow motion.
Love it!  Can't quit playing.
But hard
Very addictive game!
All I can say is I'm addicted
Idk
I'm like a kid in a candy store (no pun intended)
The game is good and addictive; I wish it had an undo button.
"This game is so easy an very entertaining.
Better than sliced bread."
:)
Muy entretenido
Addicting!
I love the game, it has just the right level of challenge. I wish the booster wheel was grayed out or something when you can't spin it.
This game is not only fun, but a good brain buster. Requires strategy!
good games
Best game ever
"I love candycrush but HATE the chocolate sq
Get rid of it so I can get to level 60+"
Muy buen juego
Amazing
Love this app level 63
A addictive game that progressively get more difficult as you go. It can be played when you only have a few minutes. I love this game!
<U+2764><U+FE0F><U+2764><U+FE0F><U+2764><U+FE0F>This game!
My favorite game
:D
This game is so sweet that I have to see the dentist every time I play it.
Fun game. Addicting. Thumbs up!!!!
I was on level 121 and then I hi back to play it again and I was on level 10 this is a true story
FUN
I was on level 277 and the game reset..... I am now back at level 1. Has anyone else had this problem?
Awesome!
This game is so fun I can play it four hours.
Love it! Wish lives would charge in 10 minutes and not 20. Also allow you to keep help from friends in your mailbox.

Pretty fun game to pass time while waiting in line or at the dr's office.  I don't pay for extra moves so I just play till my lives run out.  Not too many problems with crashing on my iPhone 4s.
"Since the last update in Nov. the game does not load. Why so many problems lately?

Writing again...please fix the problem of not being able to download the game!!"
Great app I love it
Ive been playing this for a couple years now, and it's still fun! I really like the booster wheel, great addition to the game!
Great game very addicting. Only flaw is I don't get the daily spin due to it saying can't connect to store or server.
This game is the most fun thing to do when you have time to burn.
Love it
Cool
Wish I could contact App Store so I can proceed to next level... It's said "failure to contact store" for past couple of updates!  This is for the birds...
:)
ADDICTIVE!!!
The only issue I have is when my iPad shuts down when I'm doing well in the game!  I not only lose a life it doesn't save my points! I've blown a lot of high scores due to that issue.
Play it
"My game just went to level 1 and i was all they way up at about 254. So annoying!
Am not on facebook it is also annoying when u cant sign on another way like they did to Farm heros."
I just passed Level 350 but, I cannot request Tickets from my Candy Crush friends. The game freezes up as soon as I select my friends & hit Send. Help! I don't want to start over. Please fix my game!
This game provides hours of mindless fun. Enjoy!
This game is awesome addictive and difficult all in one
Nice
Addictive! I love this game!
So much fun to be had
So addictive! Want to earn more FREE gold bars!!!
My daughter has me addicted! Fun game! I don't spend cash and have no trouble passing levels!
Niice
Sahssh
Love it!!!
So much fun and addicting. Very well made and I can't put my phone down! Great for me (40 yrs) and my son (6 yrs).
This game is ok I've never paid a cent and I'm at level. #313
"I have been playing Candy Crush for a few months and was up to level 115. I ran out of lives this afternoon and later got the usual message that I once again had a full set of lives. When I went back to play I was HORRIFIED and shocked to find that my game had been set back to level 1!!!!! ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME King games???!!! WHY?! It was annoying enough when they took away my daily booster spin because I'm not on stupid Facebook but THIS IS UNFORGIVABLE!!! Unless and until my game is restored I will never play candy crush or any other King brand game again nor will I recommend them. DO NOT INVEST YOUR TIME IN THIS GAME King will royally hose you! Apple is forcing me to give 1 star but my REAL RATING IS 0 STARS! So disappointed <f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008E>
UPDATE: A few days after posting this rant they have ACTUALLY RESTORED my game progress; working booster wheel and all! <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0083>THANK YOU for fixing my favorite game! I will amend my rating & resume happily crushing candy<f0><U+009F><U+008D><U+00AB><f0><U+009F><U+008D><U+00AC><f0><U+009F><U+0094><U+00A8> I hate to feel so embittered as to have to write a negative review so I would love it if in the future King could ensure that this does not ever happen again!!!"
Very addictive game!
!!!!!!
Candy crush forever!
Downloaded the newest update and my game reset itself.  I was at level 312...went back to 1.  Not worth it.
Love this game!! Very addicting…
I lost all my levels and I was in the 500s what the heck.
I like this game it is awesome
Best game ever
Started back playing a few days ago. Some level ms can't be beat without buying power ups.
I've had the game on my phone for over a year but didn't play until a couple weeks ago. I enjoy it but my only complaint is the rules aren't exactly clear. Took a while (and lost lives) to figure things out.
5 stars
It's absolutely fun and addicting love this game!!!
This game is so addicting and can play it for hours.
In my busy and stressful life,  candy crush is the gin in my tonic,  when the kids are in bed.
Great
Awesome
Sooooo addictive!! I have cussed and deleted and re downloaded this game a hundred times. Just can't quit it!
Great game
Love to have a challenge during the day! Fun and challenging...and of course addictive!! You need to give us more than 5 lives!!
This has been my favorite game ever.I do have one comment,hate the bombs that you added.not fair anymore...11-5-14 the last update really messed up,,now when I go in the game,,it shuts down,,can't even play it,,,so sad now,,11-11-14 still can't play.whats the prob..help!
Love it
"I absolutely love this game, but I cannot play it at all anymore. I got to level 81 and the app just kept closing as soon as I opened it. So I deleted the app and reinstalled it. This meant I had to start at level 1 again. I am now back to level 70 and now it is crashing even worse than before. I cannot open the app at all. 
The same thing happened on Farm Heroes Saga, and now on Bubblewitch 2. It only happens on King games. 
I am using an iPod touch 4... Is this the reason?"
Fun game

entretenido adictivo
Addicting
Loved this app! I deleted it a few months ago after constant crashing but with the new update it's amazing and addictive as ever!
Please fix this I'm really mad
For someone who spends hours a day traveling on NYC subways and (strap)hanging on for dear life, Candy crush is essential.
Loved this game until it gave me a wheel spin and when I hit the jackpot space (finally) it crashed. Imagine that. The fix is in!!!!
I've been playing this game for about 2 months now off and on and have found it to be a good way for me to unwind after a hard day
The designers made it super easy to waste money. In the game, you purchase optional gold bars.  You can use towards extra moves at the end of a level, lollipop smashers, etc. The game now makes you use the gold bars instead of an in-app purchase to continue on a level if you run out of moves. If you accidentally tap "keep playing", it will automatically deduct from your purchased gold bars without a confirmation, thus making you use the gold bars even if you didn't mean to. Just be careful when you run out of moves at the end of a level!
Kills time and continues to be challenging and entertaining!
Good for brain, boredom and fun, fun, fun !! Super to play when waiting or just need a break. Got my whole fam playing it
This game is as addictive as crack
I do NOT have Facebook on my iPhone.  It didn't matter.  Candy Crush tried to synch to it and dumped all my progress.  I was at level 360.  This is a serious fault.
This game is cool and exciting. But it needs a little improvement.
Great game. Super fun. I cant put it down.
Lol this is a game
Love it
Great game!
Super fun addictive game
Amazing
Enjoy it a lot
THE BEST game ever!!!!!
Tiffi Is So Cute And Mr. Toffe Is Very Helpful!* It's Fun To Play And I'm Glad My Friends Are Also Playing!* Happy Thanksgiving Soon!* SarahAnnFreuler/NekoSarah/LightingStar/SarahWolf!*
This is an awesome game!!!
Love it!
Since the new update I have gotten to my next level and I need tickets. I go to ask my friends for tickets and every time I do and hit send the entire app freezes. PLEASE fix this so I can continue to play my most favorite game in the universe. Thank you.
Once you get going it's hard to put it down. Very fun and challenging.
Has a few issues, but overall a great game!
I went to play this morning (level 178) and when I opened the app it had erased all levels in both worlds and started over at level 1!!! This is so frustrating!!! Also I went to get help and send an email and the info was all messed up on the page. It was just gibberish on the screen. So I was unable to send a help form to the help department. Please fix!!!
I have played this game for almost a year, and i was at level 152 yesterday. Today when i wanted to play, it lost all my progress and now i am at level 1 again? I didn't delete it or did anything that could cause this. I have rebooted my phone a few times and it doesn't want to go back like it was. Is there a way to get it back, because there is no way in hell i am going to start at the beginning again.
FUN, FUN, FUN!!!
It is very fun
Great game
I like this bc it gives me something to do when I'm bored but they should give u the option to skip a level once in awhile when u get stuck on one and want to throw your phone thru the wall.
The greatest past time ever
Love playing this games. Better then going to a casino. Wish we won actual money, kind of like the lottery. Hahahaha jk :)
God I love this game although my girlfriend is having an issue not being able to spin the bonus wheel because it wants her yo hook to Facebook which she doesn't have nor ever has. If this could get corrected the game would even be better. Anyone out there care or have a solution?
Love :)
Love this game, very addictive
I love the challenges but I had difficulty trying to figure out how to progress to Chocolate Mountain???
Very addictive and relaxing game.
Since I downloaded the newest update, I can't even play the game. It crashes every time that I hit the play button.  I've tried every fix that they have suggested, but nothing helps.  I've emailed support, but never received a reply.  If I could give this app zero stars, I would.  Please fix this!
Love, love, love! So addicting!
Great fun
Love it!!!!!!!
Love this game!
Game has become schizophrenic. Progress appears and disappears randomly.
Great!!
Good stuff
I have been spinning the wheel every day since the booster option started and I have never ever stopped on the JACKPOT once.  It has been close or started to stop on it but the wheel will not ever stop on it.  What is up with that.  Why wouldn't you want us to get that once in a while.
This is still an addictive game !!
Good times
I love this game sleep at Night and helps me not to get stressed out so much
Okay I'm on level 102 and after the last update I get on without Internet it starts me all over from level 1 it took me a while to get to level 102 and it's making me restart come on now. I mean the game is very addictive. And I love the game but that's a lot of work to do all over again.
"After spending time and money to get to level 60 the game reset to the beginning.
WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY WHY??????????"
I was on a very high level and one day I went on and I was on level 1. I had spent money and time to get there! Ridiculous!
I was on level 200 and downloaded a new app last night and it cleared this app as if I had just downloaded and now I have to start at level 1.
Every time I update I get pushed back to level one!!!! That's not cool. At all. If I have to start over each time there's an update it's not worth it. But it is still Very addictive.
Yay
Always come back to this game. <U+2764><U+FE0F>
Ever since I downloaded the latest up grade, the game crashes when I hit play.  the advice I recieved from King made no sense.  the booster wheel works but that is all.  Help!!!!!!
Challenging and enjoyable...
Great update thanks!
Fdghu
Love the gave.  Last update changed something so that it crashes when or just before the level opens.  Will not run on my first generation iPad .  App support only sends me automated responses, none of which fix the problem.
Some glitches but a fun game when traveling.
I'm so addicted to this game!
Fun game!
AFTER COMPLETING THE UPDATES, I CAN NO LONGER PLAY WHEN WHEN I HAVE NO SIGNAL. I USED TO BE ABLE TO PLAY ON A PLANE OR WHILE ON THE SUBWAY UNDERGROUND WITH NO CELL SIGNAL. AFTER THE UPDATES YOU CAN NO LONGER PLAY WITH NO SIGNAL! I HATE THIS! I WILL NOT PLAY UNTIL THE ABILITY TO PLAY WITHOUT A CELL SIGNAL RETURNS! HOW RIDICULOUS TO TAKE THIS FEATURE AWAY!
Only game I can all day long & never bored! I LOVE CANDY CRUSH!!!!!
Fujfjjdkdkdkdj
thanks for adding the boosters that can be earned. it has made playing more fun. i am hooked on the game.
Love crushing! Even when I stop playing for a bit, the fun just picks right back up
I think anyone who has a smart phone ori pad has it already lol
I don't have a Facebook account, but CC keeps telling me that my Facebook account has expired. It will not let me spin the Dailey candy wheel. It will also send me back to the start, negating all my progress if I am not connected to wifi.
It's a very good and nice game
Great game
I sold my soul to the Canadian Devil and all I got was this fancy app.
Love this game!
This app works great and it's very addicting...everyone I know plays it great job
"Tons of fun... 
Can't wait for the new game!!!"
Bae loves this
It's about time I can log back in to Facebook to play
Fun game. Higher levels really make you think ahead. Good game.
Love how it's tons of fun... Never gets boring because as you continue it's keep changing.... I also love that can play at any time of the day especial on road trips!!!
Love the game but every time  I start loading the game on my iPad it shuts done and uses up lives. The games doesn't even start before it Akers a life and shuts down. Can you please fix this bug. Pretty aggravating.
Funfun
I feel that when your computer is down you should be able to pick back up where you started.. Wasn't not happy about starting over when I was on level 158 . You need too work on fixing the problem .
Pretty good game. I like it very much.
Best App I give it 5stars
Totally addictive!
Great game
Good
Absolutely my favorite game to play.
Awesome
Great game. Don't like paying at different levels or asking for more lives on FB.  One time charge should be sufficient .

I just wish if your stuck on a level for a certain amount of time you could just pass it."

I love the game, but I just tried to purchase additional lives. It deducted 12 gold bars, but did not give me the lives.
Easy to use and very fun to play. Recommend to everyone.
Good for everyone, this game I had the longest on my phone
Can't stop playing...
I filled out this review for the boosts.
Great game! My go to time killer

I love this game
This game is very challenging and you'll get mad at it when you lose but it's still fun to play
Very addictive!
Not sure what happened, but I opened up the app to continue my play from earlier today and the game has wiped out my levels and I'm at "1" again.  Not too happy right now.
Fun way to pass time
I'm addicted.
Very addicting!!
Cool aplication ..................... I like play
Love it. Takes patience to not buy extra moves but it does help with stress.
Mine keeps shutting down and won't work... I can't even play it anymore because it just shuts down! Can someone please fix that! It was one of my most favorite games!
For two weeks now I can't get on - started w shutting down during a game or spinning the wheel- before that it was getting slow .. Have deleted it twice and when I go to get a new one it shows it's still in my I cloud- so and comes back w kicking me off .... Any suggestions ??? I rally love this game and I miss it .. Yours truly Kathleen McCarty (56) yrs young :)
Luv da game
Love the game. Almost finished but since last update I haven't been able to play. The game just keeps crashing on me.  Please fix.
Enjoy playing this game on occasion.
Nsuavd
Love this game!  But the latest update crashes me out when i click play.  FIX THIS NOW PLEASE!!!!!!!!
Great game <f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008F><f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008F>
Great game..
Enjoy playing while watching TV. Definitely could use my time better but I like playing. Wish it was cheaper to use the boosters.
Really enjoy the mindlessness of this game.
Enjoy!!
Can't stop playing Almost done!! Only 30 more levels
Very very good
Ever since installing the latest update I can no longer play. I see a lot of similar comments. Is this going to get fixed?
Everytime I get upset with this game and put it down I pick it right back up.
Great simple fun
Just awesome and challenging. Keep updating
I love this game
For some reason I can not get the game to continue. I played on the original IPad and it just does not load the game. Would like to continue but I can't. What's up with this? I can only NOT recommend this game to anyone. Ready to post on Facebook the problems I am experiencing.
Good game
"This game is very addicting I can't stop playing it... 
Great game!!!"
Can't get enough!!!!!!
I love it
Very addicting but it can get expensive
Thought this game was stupid until I started playing. Now I can't stop. Haven't spent a dime and well past level 200.
Very addicting!
Epic
Too much fun!
When it was working, higher levels are ridiculously difficult and the game is more frustration than entertainment. Also, the Booster wheel doesn't work unless connected to a stupid Facebook account. That's annoying as hell, especially since their web site claims full functionality of the game without a Facebook account (which I do not have and never will). With the latest update, it no longer runs on my iPod Touch - crash on launch. Developer support is unresponsive. I guess my annoyance with the game levels is now resolved in that the game doesn't play anymore, either due to bugs in the code or bugs in iOS. I will never download another King game, period.
Love this game! Can't put it down
Cool
Add
Love this game
Wife's fault she ask me to help her, now I can't stop playing ;)
Can't stop playing it! I love it!
Fun
Entertaining
Wonderful
Me and my family love this game it's easy and free you just got to learn how to make moves to set up the big points
Love it
very sweet. i live it
Candy crush is a great game. Hours of fun!
Keep beating level 108 but then says I failed when I completed the level.  Please fix
Just wish there was more "free"
It is a fun game, but you don't give detail directions, like how to you use the boosters you get.
Good game that gets you to think and be fun at the same time!
like the game so far so good 128 yay
Absolutely love the game, but the fact that on a hard level it can take me weeks and I can basically play for 5 minutes at a time, ruins it. I will download it again when they get rid of this horrible idea. I really hope game developers realize how asinine this trend is.
Lots of fun!<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008E>
Love this game!!!
Don't play if you're prone to addiction.
Love this game!!!
Really enjoy this game. Challenging and entertaining.
Love it Post
Thank you for making it easy without Facebook!
Love this game
Yup
Fun
Amazing addicting
Love it
I love the game but after the last update it will no longer play on my first gen ipad, I have deleted and reloaded it several times.
Love it. Just wish there was unlimited plays.
I love this game! I can't stop playing.
Awesome game
This game is quite fun.  It wold be even better with different music and if lives would return at a quicker rate.
Love this game
Crashes and takes a life every time it crashes
Love it!
It's fun & addictive, but I won't pay to play.
I love this game but since the last update I crash every time and then I lose a life. PLEASE fix it.
This game is so addictive. It's too much fun. I like how every stage has different challenge.
Didn't like that I had to start over when it forced me to sign with Facebook, but I did anyway.
So sweet it's addicting.
Addicting, annoying and aggravating! That's why I play!
This game is awesome
An addicting game, visually beautiful, but very frustrating because some levels are rigged in order to get you to pay. Eventually you'll get through, but could take weeks. I wish King offered a for purchase game that is straightforward and winnable each time on luck and my abilities.  Even understanding the way it works , I still come back as the game does help me relax and unwind.
Just a game
Just addictive
I'm addicted !
Can't put it down
Highly addictive!!
Excellent game!
Well done Candy Crush!  I have just downloaded latest update on iPad and it now crashes every time while game is loading. I have tried more than a dozen times!  Oh well I now don't have to waste anymore time on this addictive game.
Great game
Love it
Love love love it
I was so hooked on this game until my Nanna played it and connected face book and she just starting to play when she finished playing she logged out and instead of level 125 I was on level 6 plz fix this otherwise good game
What the King???? We complained at the last "update" that we couldnt use the sponning wheel unless we were in facebook so you fix that BUT NOW you have reset all our hard work & in app purchases back to level 1 unless we are logged into facebook!! What a bunch of theives you are!!!! Shame on you, you should be ashamed!!!!!
Super addictive!
Good way to pass the time... Brush off the stress of the day.. Without putting on wait.
"Played for over 1 year.
Latest update DELETED my game.
Why?"
I play Candy Crush in meetings. I just love it!!
Love the game even my 3 yr old helps mum out now and then lol
Ok, I'm hooked on this now after been shown from a friend.
After your latest update my progress on the game has gone from level 410+ back to level 1. I've lost all progress :(
Very addictive
Fun
:)
It's so fun that at some points I wanted to rip out my hair and it occasionally causes Tourette's syndrome, five stars will play again :)!
It might not rock your gaming world, but for a quick easy fun game, it's great. And sooooo many levels. Every update keeps on adding levels for FREE. Totally worth it.
Love the game, very addictive
The game i love what im dissapointed in is that - i was at level 614 and have been playing for quite sometime and i am one of those very few ppl that have facebook so none of my levels are saved i also have spent a bit of $$ in boosters and going through quests. My daughter loged in facebook on my iphone and it syncronized all her levels to my phone which took me back to level 12 - how could this do at least synronise with the phone that the app is on and being played on not by a persons profile - i also sent 2 emails to candycrush admin and nothing not even a automessage well get back 2 u -   now i dont play anymore games from king!!! especially candy crush they make the games addictive so u spend $$ and no prob but courtesy goes a long way
Since I updated this game not only has it somehow gone back to the beginning , it won't even let me play the game at all .It keeps shutting down .What have you done? Please rectify!!!!!!!!
Going along fine now all of a sudden after the last update it goes to the play screen, freezes and reset to the main iPad screen. Very disappointed. How do I fix this???
G game
As above
Love it
Great game, but have just finished a level, & it stalls when asking facebook friends to continue into next level, very annoying!!!!
Don't install this update if you are still using an iPad 1. Game won't load at all and you will waste a lot of time trying time and time again until you realize it's pointless.
By the time it increases your ability to see what you are looking at
The only thing I would recommend, is more lives. Other then that great game!
Great game, just wish I could get more gold without paying actual money.
Love this game, as it becomes more challenging in each section.  Have never had a problem loading the wheel, but am using iPad.  Can't go wrong with this game
Whenever I open the app, it closes again when I've barely got past the loading page! This is the third time I've got the app and it still does it. Please fix this problem!
Pretty fun app, good game to play to pass time
Great

Candy crush is an awesome game. I'm classed as 'addicted' by my family cos I won't put it down.
Great game .. Stuck on level 86 ..
Since the last update I can't play anymore the game gets to the loading stage and then closes are you able to fix this please
Sometimes easy, sometimes extremely difficult. This game is addictive.
Great time waster whilst in a queue, now I'm addicted!
Wish I wasn't suck in !!!!
Since the latest update candy crush crashes when loading a game. Just adding my frustration to the list of users that this is happening to. Unhappy crushing
Best game, been playing nonstop and still fun!
A terrific time waster...
The last update crashes every now and then. Please fix it...
Holy sheet! Addictive as a mother
I got a reward for writing this review. I did get 50 gold bars once but then they disappeared. I am happy playing for days or a week before going to the next level without ever paying. Addicted
Candy crush is addictive
Yay

Enjoying playing game, great to play
Hi, since your last update and the new game alert I cannot play any game - it drops out as soon as I hit play and as I still have credit I would appreciate a fix to the problem.   Thanks in advance.
Very addictive!
Love it! Best game ever
Another update fail... Rather than not loading as what happened with your last update .. It's now taken me back to level 1 with recent update. Now each time I open its either at my level or its back to level 1. What a joke!!
Gggggg
After the new update I have to be connected to the Internet or my whole game resets back to square one and I have spent too much of my time on this dumb (but addictive) game for this to happen please sort that out the first time I thought i had lost all my progress and I freaked out
So disappointing to find all levels have been lost since the last update. Like others, I will not be continuing to play... Too bad candy crush :(
The app keeps crashing in my ipod every time I complete a level. And now it wont even load the game before crashing on me. Please help me it's really frustrating!
Love it I can't put it down
Very fun game
good game
Loveeeee it!
It's hard to stop when you 2 hours free lives!  Like that I don't have to be on facebook!  Don't like the 24 hours to play next quest.
Hello to all, can anyone help me in game-130, l don't know what to do have been stuck on it for a while and still don't get it, l would appreciate someone's help please.. Thank you...
Good fun
You guys must be so rich by now how about sharing the wealth
It's good and proper fun.Llllllfmfmkdjkyikfnfjjjfhjhjfjfjjjjjjfjghhkxkdldkldkdmvkfmkrkdkdlldll
I'm hooked line and sinker
Having fun everyday!!! Best game ever made... Very addictive... ^_^
Great app
The only game I play regularly on my phone, but will take opportunity to delete and live in the real world!
Got the last update and now the game won't open. Got up to level 102 and when I tap on that the screen goes black and back to iPod menu. PLEASE HELP I'm missing the game.
Again another expensive pay as you go game that's just not worth the money you spend on it.
Love this game!
I can't load the game to play. Every time I click play, it loads but then goes off and takes me back to my iPad home screen. Very, very annoyed. Please fix.
Good fun xxxxbut why too expensive !!!
Again, just tried to play, again used up all my lives trying to play. Even though I still had plenty of moves, suddenly it's you've used up all your moves, NO I HAD NOT!!!!! Do not like this game anymore. I am starting to hate it, a lot!!!!!
I love it only bad thing is the lives
Extremely addictive
Did an update 2 days ago and now the game keeps crashing. How about fixing it please
Only for free stuff
"What the hell is with level 717??? Clearly it's impossible to pass with needing 4 freckles and you have 4 bombs ticking away
The actual structure of the grid makes it impossible to get any freckles, watch on you tube and other pop woke don't have bombs and structure of grid is different?????? 
Please fix otherwise DELETING the game"
Thanks candy crush makers. Keep up the good work!
Love this game to bits and two months ago I sadly lost my progress and went to level 350 to 0. Didn't mind it but now it's crashing all the time, can't even play it at all, very disappointing...
The most recent update was not good. when i try to play Candy Crush, it freezes and then the screen goes black and then closes out. this is ridiculous. please fix this problem.
Great game for all
Love the game, very addictive
Crashes everytime I open, please fix this. I love the game but can't get into it to play
Love candy crush
Very frustrating at times, but a good game.
Fun n addictive
Just when you're about to pull your hair out cos you're stuck on a level you finally get through to another harder different level..... Hate the cheating spinning wheel... Rips off too many definite jackpots haha
Wastes way too much of my time!
Extremely addictive game, provides infinite entertainment!

Game would be terrific if it didn't crash whenever you try to lay it. Since recent upgrade I haven't been able to at this or any other King game. Very disappointed. Will be deleting this app and focussing on playing Team Lava games from now on as they are similar and do not crash.
Such a great addicting game! Cant wait for the new game
Fun game, very addictive, can't put it down.
Been addicted for quite awhile and all of the sudden it went back to level on :(
I was on level 167 but after updating I am on level 1 again and guess what, I am not interested in play it again from the beginning
Was on level 188 or somewhere around there and after this recent update have now all of a sudden gone all the way back to level 1! Absolutely ridiculous, the amount of time I've given to this game to have it all ripped out from under me. FIX!
"Omg I love this game 
It has been hook line and sinker"
I updated and my levels reset :( please help I was up to 176 #notimpressed
As much as I enjoy playing this game, I refuse to start playing at level 1 all over again after getting to somewhere between levels 130 and 140. I'll be deleting the app.
More addictive than sugar!
Great game.
I'm obsessed.
Best most addictive game ever
"They are giving me free stuff to write a review. 

I did have to pay some in game gold to progress a level which is stupid. 

Oh and if the game crashes while loading a new level and you have elected to use a power up well then you have simply lost said power up. Fix this."
After the update, Everytime I try to ask ticket from Facebook friends it Freezes.. I can't ask for tickets to reach the next episode.. I am stuck in same level.
Addictive game, helps keep the grey matter active.
Stimulation excitement and relaxation <f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008C>
Great game easy to get addicted to
Love it very challenging on some levels awesome fun!!!!
Excellent. Game. Very challenging.  But great fun.but I had reached Level 523 and lost all levels

Addictive and annoying but brilliant

Great game
After updating my game, I lost all my levels!! Please fix this!
Been addicted for a year now and wishing I wasn't. Updated to latest version today to find all my levels have been reset and I'm  back to square one. Taking this opportunity to delete the app. Thanks for the nudge Candy Crush! :)
Love it
Don't bother downloading. Was on level 383 and the latest update reset my progress. Noticed it's happened a lot.
"I was on level 426 and everything reset....back to level 1....
It kept telling me my Facebook account session expired... I don't have a Facebook account....
This is so frustrating, yet so addictive."
After updating I am back to level one, can you please fix this immediately
Love the challange
I haven't been able to load the game since two updates ago!! (Since 27 Oct). Can't get past "Loading page" - keeps crashing/closing app! Sometimes I might make it to the levels map but then it will drop out after that! Latest update on 5 Nov didn't rectify this. Surely you're aware of this by now?! It's been weeks!! I'm up to level 404 so am clearly an addict. Give me back my vice!!!!!
"Addictive game
Love it"
Can't get into game since latest update. Drops back to Home Screen after pushing Play. Please fix.
Can't stop playing
Played level 713, ran out of lives, updated app went to play level 713 and it's changed! It now includes bombs and one bomb covered in film surrounded by licorice squares! It's impossible to pass! The old version had a freckled candy surrounded by striped candy...
Best game ever<f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008C><f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008C>
Please change the way you have your gold bars button over the give up button. I've wasted 36 bars as you have designed to rip off people the gold bar button just above the give up button.
After this updated, my 369 levels disappeared, along with, who knows how much money on spent on the upgrades!
It's funny.
Thank you for fixing all the problems. I now have full access without having to have Facebook. My favourite game!
Fun
Rating it for the free boosters. :)
"awesomely addictive
makes boring train journeys fly by. love it"
On leaves 56 not going to be a 57 no way to get all bottom ones gone what's going on ?
Great game. Heaps of levels.
Good
I was on level 157 or around that but then as soon as I updated it the game refreshed and now I'm back to level 1!!!! This also happened to my friend who was on level 50. can you somehow fix this and get our levels back?!
Very addicting game. Love it!
Always fun. Challenging.
"I have seven bars left but can't use them as you always want more  to finish my game    
and I will not buy any 
you must know what we have. why can't you add gold bars to the wheel or you could make it that we can swop gold bars for hammers 

I love the game"
Excellent
Have just loaded your latest update and now cannot get past the home page. It just drops out whilst trying to load the game! Not Happy!

Good game to kill time. Run out of lives quickly.
Addictive

I am obsessed with candy crush and even though tho I can still be on the same level for 3 months it really helps u use your mind.. Love it. Need more free boosters tho
Great way to wind down :-)
It's a gd game
Good fun
Very addicting
Fun and really addictive...warning you now!
Best ever
Fantastic!
I am an avid player.  None of my requests to get to the next level are ever responded to by my friends, whom I know play. I always end up paying. I believe they know who will pay and who will not and therefore requests don't go through.  Now they've changed how you can purchase new lives...
Too addictive!!
Have been playing for 2 months, really love it.
"You broke the game when you updated it and made it so much more linked to Facebook. Can't even play a game - crashes every time. Fix it now please
1 out of 5 because I can't play ONE GAME."
I have avoided this game for years, I am so glad I did. It keeps you trying trying trying
Best game, my go to when I want to kill time
Great game
Ok
Tricky but fun
Ok
I am totally hooked on this game - it's absolutely brilliant
Awesome!!!!!
Addictive
Awesome
Enjoyable game
Can get annoying when you can't through the levels...
I love this game
Greatest game ever!!
I love this game. Addicted. Omg. Hehe.
Hours of fun
Will you please remove all the extra garbage from the screen! There are so many advertisements for other games it is so hard to see where you are up to!! I don't want to play what you keep trying to push down my throat!! How about a button that says, yes I have seen that, I don't want it, and now I never have to see it again! For gods sake please!!!!!!!!!!!
Awesome
Nice I am quite hooked to this addictive game
This is a fun game!
Never received the jackpot in hundreds & hundreds of spins, nearly always fish or lolly pop no matter what you do differently. Is this a scam or what ??? Disgruntled!
Love he game but hate getting stuck on levels
Very cool game I'm over 295 getting really hard now. Thank you for passing my time with your great game xxxxx
"Following one update, seems I couldn't claim my daily prize without logging into Facebook. Logged in, and lost all my progress. From level 340 back to level 1.

Sent email but no response. Hope they get it sorted."
Hooked on this
Still very addictive ...
Love it
great
It's a money trap time killer.
Once you start it is hard to stop.
Love the game can't stop playing
Hating having to pay or wait to move on from levels
love it so much
So good. Level 50 took two months to three star.
Always a good challenge
Great game additive
I absolutely love candy crush and it is in my top 3
Good way to waste time.
Game is great, could supply more lives.... Give more helpful special items, eg: fishes, colour candy!!! More lives is a must!!!
It's a very good game
Awesome!
Great game
Game annoys me when it keeps insisting on me logging into Facebook <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0081>
Great game, been playing it for over a year, one thing l hate is I've never got jackpot on the daily spins.
A very addictive game .. Hard to put down!
The best addictive game I have ever played great <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0081><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0081><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0081><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0081>

Unlimited levels, amazing updates, challenging, varying levels.

My only pet hate is the chocolate!!!!!!! But no one can really hate chocolate??"
Awesome game

Awesome game. Just when I think I will not play any more it lures me back in
Love the game
Great game, very addicting. I'm obsessed with this game and kinda feel a little peckish after playing the game <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008B><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008B>
Too addictive!!
Love it love it
I love that I can play this offline as well as on. It's a shame though that boosters need to be used to pass a level. Love the daily bonus wheel. It helps a lot
I have so much fun! Entertaining, and great when bored!
Good
Yep, addicted
Pretty cool makes you think don't go the short cut
Allan's great
Great game!

Biggest pain is running out of lives. 5 are not enough. Ha ha

Sooo addictive ! Love it
I love this game, it's addictive.
This is a favorite
Fun game, easy to learn... But gets boring after a while
This is one of my favorite games
Awesomely addictive
Love it. Great way to relax at the end of the day
Candy crush is the best game all the levels are very different and challenging! It's a very addictive game so when you start you Finnish!!
Unlike other games, I just keep coming back to this one
I'm completely addicted!
Completed 650 levels. Love it <f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008D><f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008D>
i loveeee this game, once you start it's hard to put the game down
Pretty good game
Great game, but once you encounter problems, no help from customer service. A problem recently occurred causing thousands of users to lose progress (i was up to level 496), but they havent bothere to restore us to where we were. Terrible considering how much money and time was spent. See the forums, lots of unhappy ex-Candy Crushers!
Love this game! Can't stop playing it!!!
Love this game. Very challenging at times
Like it
My psychiatrist said this this game will get me thinking clearly again, retrain and increase my memory and will stop me having psychotic thoughts, totally addicted
"I love the game so much I wanna keep playing. There is 1 problem. If u r continuously updating this game, make sure it the game doesn't crash because right now since the last update it keeps crashing when I start playing a level. For the next update please try to make sure that candy crush saga doesn't crash at all.

Also it would be great if we play candy crush on more than 1 device we should able to continue where we left off. Example if someone is playing on their iPod touch and the player is on level 313, the other devices should able to play level 313 on example an iPad, because that person does not want to start from level 1. The play should be able to play the level that they are currently on."
An awesome game to play
"Love it. 
Addictive."
Wow! This game will be explosive with more colour bombs that will make this game a blast!
Fun game to play
This is such a great game!
Great fun when you've got 5 spare mins. Truly challenging too.
Addictive but great fun it's good to have lots of friends playing to get extra lives
Love Candy Crush! Have to play it daily.
Been playing for two years and the challenges are still just as rewarding when they are achieved. Great way to numb the mind for a mum who can't take her mind off her to do list for two seconds unless playing cc.
I like this
Cool game
Absorbing game, so frustrating!
Addictive!!
This game is lots of fun and very addictive
Love it. kills time when I'm bored!
Lots of fun
Great
Addictive fun. Sometimes addictive frustrating fun.
Great game
Really nice and hard working game recommend to everyone who likes something challenging <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+009A><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0089><U+263A><U+FE0F>
Great game, the only down side is if you're about to die you should be able to get the "special candy" that you have accumulated through the game, it may just get you through - and you did earn them!!
Good fun. Though it is a bit quick to take your money if you accidentally click... Needs a 'are you sure' question. I'd be more willing to spend money on credit if I didn't think it was going to take it for things I didn't mean to spend it on.
Very fun
Such a fun and enjoyable game!
Fills the time in nicely.
This game chantingly sweet best game ever
Candy Crush is definitely the best app on the market so far. I remember on how I did not want to delete the game just because of my storage space!!! It's super awesome
I love the game and trying to work out the best strategy to get those three stars! I even like the quests I have to do because I'm not connected to Facebook<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008B>
Been stuck on 425 for at least 6 months don't play it anymore, I'd gladly pay to get passed it
My app won't even open and I'm up to level 215 and I used to play it all the time now I can't even get into the app.
Addicted
nice
Great game. Addicted.
But alas, no more.
Very fun
That is fun
:)
Good & interesting
They're just looking for ways to make money now, nearly everywhere you tap it's asking you to purchase something
Can't stop.
Best game ever!!!
Very challenging game. 5 lives is good or I'd most likely play all day
Love it
Beware! Once you start you just can't stop! Love this game! Have to get my fix everyday!!
Have had this game for over a year and still enjoy playing. The novelty wears off most games far too quickly, this one continually pleases
Love zoning out on the bus playing candy crush
This is a totally addictive game. Love it, but it's good to take a break every so often.
"So addictive, sometimes a real
 challenge"
Love the game carn't stop playing it
Very addictive
Awsome game. Some very hard but challenging

Love this game. It's so addictive and just can't keep away. Love how all the levels are so different and a different challenge level. Keep up the challenging level upgrades.
I love it
Such an addictive game, where have all the hours gone. Great for passing time on night shift
I play this everyday. I get over having to wait for my lives to refresh. Addictive.

Best game ever
Good! Love it
"Please stop crashing mid game.
Again please, please, please stop crashing.

3rdrequest!!!! Please fix the crashing issue.I barely get to play at all.

Keep crashing.Your problem solving department is hopeless and completely uninterested in your customers.

6thFeb.
4th request.Do you even read your customer reviews? Obviously not.Meanwhile the game continues to crash.

8th Feb. Is it possible to even play this game at all? Crash,crash crash and still no sign of fixing the problem.

10th Feb.Crash on.Your customer service is a disgrace.

11thFeb.Keep crashing.You really are the worst customer service(no pun intended) that I have come across.

12th.Feb. What a surprise - crash,crash.Maybe one day someone will listen !!!!

13th.Feb.Oh dear. Still crashed,!!! IS ANYBODY LISTENING ?????

14th.Feb.No response!!No assistance!!Crash! No game.Again.

Crashed continually for 48 hours.Please fix.

It is now more than a week since I had any luck with this game not crashing.From previous experience I know you do not give a care about your customers and I have no hope of ever having this problem fixed.

Tried again and was proved right.You have no customer service at all.Crash!Crash!Crash!
26th.July.  Over a week since a game opened without crashing.Is anyone listening???

1st.August. Agree that game should be Candy Crash.However there will never be any response or assistance with this,!

Would be nice to see new update of 14 October but continual crashing has so far made that impossible!!!

Still haven't been able to open last update so there is no chance I will ever get to see this one."
So very very addictive
Nice game
Very well thought out and increasingly challenging!
What the hell. This update COMES NOW. I've already had this update from 2 weeks ago and already finished these stages. Need more levels please.
Gets annoying but then awesome once i get to clear the level after days of waiting to beat it :3
Very addictive but it needs more life's
Sometimes to hard to level up though!!!
Extremely addictive
Great to pass the time playing candy crush while sitting on the train
"Frustrating levels <f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008E>
And I hate this game, you just stolen me, that's not fair I clicked on the money icon by a mistake. I want my money back."
This game is so addictive. It has made me so unproductive
Totally addicted to candy crush...best game ever
"Love candy crush. What a brilliant, addictive game. All levels are passable but you sometimes need to work on them. 
I love that you only get 5 lives because you can have a mandatory break. Or you can just play on multiple devices!!"
Great game.
This game is awful.
Fun
Addicted!!
Answer = addiction
"I'm seriously addicted to this game but haven't been paying any money towards advancement, hence the very slow progress. But, pleased to say, I'm getting there!
I've noticed the ""free bonuses"" are few and far between. Ah well, keeps me amused (tube, train, bus, Dr's waiting room etc.)!
Thanks King, for keeping me occupied! Love it! 
PS: an occasional, juicy sugar bonus would be SWEET! Free, of course."
Best game ever so much content for a app  THANK YOU for creating this!!!
Sick game
Pretty good game get around it all the time
Just a little too keen for you to make in app purchases, although you can resist the urge and play patiently.
Very addictive but relaxing.
Perfect game to kept your attention
Very good
Drives me insane but what a challenge....
Challenging, pretty and very fun :)
Nice game
Loads of fun having fun keep it coming
some levels are hard, but eventually you'll get there.
Good fun but can be frustrating
The best game ever lol, any age can play for fun or to test the mind, 4/5 Stars.
I'm sooo addicted to this game
Addictive!!
"level 688
Unachievable without payment"
Great game!!
Highly
We all love this game xx
Great
Awsome game really makes you think takes your mind of annoying people for a little bit
So so so addictive and challenging but really fun and definitely one of my favourites!!!
Good game very addictive
This game is a must-have in your App Store. Once you have it on your phone you will not be able to stop playing it, you will get hooked! Hapes of fun and very challenging.
We all compete against each other.
Great
Such a great game that is very addictive!
Good brain teasers
Booster wheel obviously stops at predetermined point, and nothing to do with when player presses stop. Even if it lands on big prize, one last click after a long pause and voila... No more major prize! Shame game isn't bad besides that.
Addictive good fun
"Only just started to play & I shouldn't hVe Started coz I'm addicted to play every
Spare moment I have !!"
So addictive and mentally frustrating. I introduced my mother to it and she came into my room at 1am looking for a charger so she could keep playing candy crush<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00B9> seriously the best game ever xx
Well
Best time killa
"No skill involved just a game of chance . In app purchases are way too expensive , just a rip off .
Figured out SAGA means repetitive grap."
Good game to kill the time.

Frustrating as hell sometimes, but an engaging and fun time waster :)
Awesome game totally addictive. Love it

Greatest and most challenging game that doesn't stop!
I would say "good game app"
Fantastic game
Definitely worth getting!!
Love it & addicted!
I resisted for so long...
Just love this game.  It just keeps on keeping on. Xx
Fun and addictive.
It's ok
tbh I couldn't get enough of this game (past-tense) except for the part where you decided to put the "purchase 5 extra moves" way too close to the "give up" button. Which I'm pretty sure you placed like that on purpose, with automatic authentication for the purchase, to coax people into accidentally using up their gold bars and forcing then to buy more as almost no one I know sends tickets for the trains anymore. After having 18 gold bars taken by accidentally pressing this button, which I knew I wasn't going to pass even still, I have decided I'm probably not going to play again as I'm not spending money in this app due to your 'carefully' placed buttons..... I'd be more than happy to have my 18 gold bars back but this will never happen nor get read in the first place, would've been a 5 star rating but now only a 2 star. May seem like a small thing but I'm confident I'm not the only one and it needs to be fixed.
Lots of fun and very challenging
excellent
Great
Tops game
I love Candy Crush... I play it way more than is healthy to admit but I have NEVER won the jackpot on the bonus wheel!! .... Come on Candy Crush...give up the Jackpot! :(
I love this game soooooooooooooooooooo much I was playing this since I was in my country till I'm in aboard :))) 5555555
Sadly you cruise through some levels and others take months to work through. The new darker world is a nice addition.
If I could ever get the jackpot on the wheel spin I would probably rate this game a 5.
Awesome game
Really fun
Love candy crush. Totally agree with the review that states about the booster wheel not giving jackpots. I want a JACKPOT !!
Good aye
You lot better fix the issue when player presses continue by accident and uses up the paid for bars.. It must have a second confirm button.. I made the mistake a couple of times and I won't buy more gold til you fix this. I think this is a trick to make the player spend all the gold asap and then need to buy more.. Greedy bunch of so and so's.. Fix it or its delete time..!
Best app game ever created!!! Addictive challenging , sooooo much fun !!!!
What's the deal with odis level 341 it actually can't be done without a shitload of boosters! Have u actually played that level and passed it?!
Awesome game
Very addictive, but I like that you need to wait for you lives so I don't play it for too long.
No matter how many times it should have stopped at Jackpot it DOESN'T STOP AND SKIPS TO THE NEXT PRIZE. UNFAIR
One of the most frustrating loveable games eva! I'm very addicted even though most of the ppl I know r ova it lol!
"If it wasn't for Candy Crush the train to and from work would be unbearable.
Thank you for my sanity!!!"
Don't know why this game is getting great reviews the company doesn't respond to emails submitted for support and the new levels are not available on mobile phones you can only play new levels via Facebook.
I love the challenge on CC but having the boost is awesome.
Just stay away or you just going to get hooked :)
Love it
This is the best game ever invented, I have a ridiculous addiction & I'm sure there are plenty of other people out there that can relate.
Great game, very addictive.
Love it!
Great game, more chances to win prizes would be good
Top game! Would play it all day if I could. Have got the whole family addicted. One down side is when collecting all orders sometimes the count doesn't budge when it should.
Would be nice if you could get gold bars for free, like watch an ad or something considering the button is in a stupid spot and you need some way to reimburse what you ACCIDENTALLY click yes to use due to poor positioning of button. Just spent 18 bars on a level I didn't want to use them on due to no confirmation of purchase and positioning. Not happy.
No
Booster wheel is definitely fixed. Never falls on the jackpot.
Very nice game
Awesome
Addictive but some levels are hard but my partner & myself swap phones when we are stuck & I complete his like that.. Then mine is eaiser :)
Very addictive!
Love it except for waiting for more lives
good
It is a great game but very frustrating and hard sometimes <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A2><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0085>
Good but hard
Can't stop
Left this app for a few months & am now back & loving it!
Keeps on challenging but I hate those swirly things!
Absolutely addictive!
Candy Crush Saga is a fun and addictive game but can also be annoying if your stuck on a level. But I like how you have separate lives between the classic game and Odus the owl's game.
Thoroughly enjoyable .. Playing for around 10 months now .. I pay on occasion but have no issue because of the hours of fun I get from it.
Never have the Booster wheel on Jackpot!:(:(
Game is great except when you have to play a level hundreds of times before you can clear it
Love it
Great fun to be had with this game!
Good fun and passes time well
Totally Addicted
I love it . It's great .
Great game unless you get stuck on the same level for weeks, then can get a bit frustrating.
Awesome!
Only issue is that when i changed phones I had to start again as it didn't save my levels, very annoyed!!
Addictive as like it ay
Awesome game it has kept me going for over 12 months now !
Well worth the download. You just avoid all the in app purchases (i.e. the special bonuses). Thoroughly addictive and challenging as the game progresses.
like it
Ok
I love it, I just don't like the pressure to sign in via Facebook.
Some levels are impossible to beat without boosters. Puts you off continuing to play
I've bought 3 lots of gold bars this week, but they haven't been added to the game, the money is taken from my account but I don't receive the gold bars. Please fix this as I have spent lots on this game.
Addictively enjoyable.
So much fun great way to pass the time
"Very very addictive not for the weak lol
Great game :)"
Love it!!! :D
Great!!
Good
Love the game but do find that some levels can only be completed if you purchase lives/boosters. I also agree with the previous person, I nor my friends have never spun up the big one! But I still keep coming back for more!!!
Great game
Try and stop <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0082>
Very good lots of fun
Yes addicted.
I love this game , very challenging,  makes you think
But hates the fact that I'm always stuck on a particular level !!!!
How can you con people to keep playing and then ruin it by losing all the levels when the system was upgraded. Time to find a better game!
"Love this game
Hours of addictive pleasure"
Lmao
Addictive!!
"Great game; addictive, fun etc. but have a complaint in regards to the booster wheel. It never falls onto the jackpot, even when it is so close, it always manages to slow down and never click over that last time! Such rubbish!! 
Also, I accidentally clicked ""play on"" on one of the levels, and it came up and said ""purchase successful"" without asking me for confirmation or anything, so I lost 9 gold bars purchasing 5 extra moves on a level I knew I wouldn't pass at all. I am very annoyed at this and would prefer confirmation in the future. 
Cheers."
Hi it's nice and good time pass for kids and young one 2<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0083><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0083><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0083><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0083><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0083><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0081>
Booster reel is rigged
Love it. So addictive.
Awesome game!
such a great game definitely would recommend would rate more if I could haha
Love this game, but since I uploaded this most recent update I haven't been able to play because it crashes on loading. Please rectify ASAP!
Offer a full version where I can pay a one off fee and not have to worry about in app purchases to reimburse lives etc after that. I refuse to pay for all that.
A great way to pass the time, super fun and really addictive!
This game is super addictive and fun, great job!!!
Once started.. Can't stop!!
Please fix this problem a.s.a.p. so I can play again as is only company I have.  My iPad also lost all the games a few updates back which had cost me a lot of money to go up levels and buy extra turns to finish games.  Was up to 310 now back to 80. iPod don't want to go back to zero as up to 275.
I don't buy gold bars often but it's really annoying how there's no confirmation before spending them on 5 extra moves etc. Its frustrating to waste them...
Es is ganz cool!
Cool game
Since I updated November 2014 game crashes, can't play at all. Should have ability to roll back. Resetting and re installing don't fix problem.  Great game when it works but now just frustrating. I might have to get a real life. Sigh
Thanks for making this app
Super fun and so very addictive!
I can't play since I downloaded the new update - it just crashes on loading every time. Turned my iPod off and on again but it made no difference.
Mean
Hi I just updated to the latest release and it's deleted all my progress (415 levels) how do I get this back?!
So addicting!
Love it.. Totally addicted

Very addictive. I enjoy the challenges!
It has not worked my profile is not back
This is a good game
ADDICTIVE
Great mental excessive but addictive
Have enjoyed playing, only issue is I can't do the daily spin as it wants me to login using Facebook and I'm not on Facebook
Levels are too hard to pass once over level 30, also kind of annoying that you need to unlock levels to play on. Other than that game is kind of fun
I like this app
Just deleted this game....impossible to play without spending money. I finally relented to pressure and spent some and it still wasn't enough go to advance to the next level.....absolute rip off.
very cool very mint I like it
Very addictive, but also frustrating!
A great game very addictive and one I've kept playing even when I've deleted others <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0080>.
Awesome game lots of fun
Awesome game, I've been playing it for 2 yrs now and it's still challenging me!! Each level getting just that little bit harder, some are easier and some harder... Keeps my brain active!
:)
It keeps crashing it's sad I luv this app so much please fix as soon as possible thx
This a great fun game, getting harder as i go.

Best game invented!!!!!
Great game
Great game. Very addictive
Pity the further you go in this game the more stuck you get if you don't buy extra boosters and lives.
Addictive but lots of fun
Doin it for the candy
The heading says it all
Awesome game hard to put down
Very addictive
Good game. Very addictive!
Perfect distress tool
I love everything about this game!
Love the game
very addictive
Great game ... Very addictive:-)
Great game
I love that game. You get never tired of playing it and has always new challenges. :)
Totally addictive !
"Got a few minutes to kill? 
Have a few goes. I've been stuck on the same level at times for months but I just come back again and again when I'm free for a few minutes and have another go."
Great
Great game
Fun way to relax after long day
We love this game hours of fun.
essential App…
Love the game, wish you could decide during the game if you would like to use your bonus candies, not at the beginning before you start.... Never got the jackpot, and wish you could earn lollipop hammers with mini games, or if you get a great score....
This game is gr8 but I'm reviewing for the three free color bombs
Be careful very addictive
Always helps me when I'm bored
Hate the chocolate but totally hooked love the challenges
I like the game but get frustrated with the wheel I've been playing for a while now and I have never landed on the trio of treats.
Love the game but annoyed that I need to wait sooo long for updates so that I can continue to play - When you do provide updates, it's only for one stage and I'm often beyond that, which means that I'm restricted to playing on my laptop
Enjoyed before latest change requiring Facebook connection.  I have no interest in connecting to Facebook. Unless changed soon out it goes.
Addictive. But when I joined Facebook it took me back to level 1 and I had been up to 400+. Very disappointing!
Super like it!!!
Great challenge has had me hooked for ages, have made my way through to without spending a cent!!
Great challenging game.
I love this game! The wheel I love but if you put a heart in it it would be perfect!!
It's great but it goes out off it some times
fun
Best game ever omg
Very catchy game.cannot get enough
Enjoy playing candy crush
Great game but super addictive!
Mean game better than the rest
It's a bit annoying all of the ads but other than that it's quite fun and it pushes you!<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008A>
Good game keep me busy
Love the challenge and mental stimulation to do sufficient to get to the next level.
Gr8 game would recommend
Weirdly can't stop playing
I recently updated this app to the recent update and now it won't open.. What's going on??
Addictive game... And has next to no loading time unlike other games.
Love the game but some frustrating things as mentioned in previous posts. More lives for each level without having to pay would be great! Otherwise I love it
O-4-Osum
Needs a new look, after having this on my phone ever since it came out, the look of the app is boring. I like the candies so not an overall change but just a fresher update to make it more slick and bright.
Great game but never hit the jackpot on the wheel yet? Does it ever happen?
Maybe it could be looked at that you could buy pass a level if it was really hard. With the wheel each day has anyone ever landed on the jackpot????
I have several of your king games which I have always played on Facebook since had to change password you are not reconnecting me it is the same account what do I have to do to correct please thanku mary
great fun - very addictive!
Far too addictive :-) love this game
Fun but addictive! <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008D>
Great game but expensive add ons
Crazy addictive yet so good!!
Love this game. 5/5:)
Love this game
Awesome & fun
Great game to unwind to!
The Best Game yet.
Goood
I am in love with this game
This is a great game because it is challenging
Mint game love it
Great game. Thank you!
Challenging but achievable!
Very time consuming lol!
Really want to play it everyday, love this game!
Loving the wheel. I would like it even more if you could send lives back to the people who have just sent some to you and also having gold bars on there too
Lately i have not been enjoying the game. It's getting boring and frustrating. Also recently with the winning wheel, i have landed on the Jackpot about 3 times then when i claim the prize it clicks over to the pinwheel biscuit thingee. Bit annoying and off puting
Great game with many challenging levels, however for those who don't want to pay for lives and boosters constantly, it's a frustration and only an occasional game. Having said that, I just wait for lives to refill and also set my own challenges, so I'm probably just a cheap addict!
Fabulous fun but I too got bumped from level 153 to level 1 when my computer synced with face book, couldn't believe it after all those hours of playing !!
Annoyingly addictive
Very fun game to play everyday. Cannot resist !
love this game!!!
Love it
Totally enjoy been challenged with the different levels.
In a good way, of course.
level 677 on the app is different from level 677 i access on my computer - not helpful, just want to pass it!
I love this game.  Great fum
Love this game. Completely hooked
I'm a bit late to the party with this but hours of fun
Makes you want to go back and have more more and more!
Only drawback is 5 lives and a stand down period
Absolutely addicted still can't get enough of this Ganesh :-)
I have an addiction to ths game
Can't think of any other way to pass the time. Keeps the brain working.
Awesome addiction
Addictive
So good!
The spinning wheel must be rigged. I have never won it since it's come about. <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1>
Nice game <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0098><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0098>
It is awesome game ever seen. Cool
Great distraction
Awsum theres how much stages im only on stage 120 & theres still heaps more!!!!
Perfect game for all ages
A game they continues to challenge, I enjoy the levels, but have only ever won the jackpot once on my daily wheel spin which makes me think the wheel is rigged.
It's pretty much all I play!
I'm addicted
Oh my god, some of the levels are so annoying and frustrating, but I keep going back for more. I think if you don't pass a level after say 15 times, you should be able to get help.
Keeps me entertained while the ads are on tv. Good escape wen I need to de-stress.
lovely game!
Criminally addictive, would like more lives. Especially on the short games. But otherwise great game.
I'm so addicted I can't drag myself away from it. So worth downloading. A game that everyone of any age can enjoy. Perfect for killing any amount of time. Perfect for simple enjoyment. What a winner
This is awesome
Not sure what's going on.  Used to get daily bonus...  Then the link now wants me to connect to FB...  But doing that resets whole game!!  Not happy when you get to level 235.... Restarted again...  Made progress, but daily bonus not appear...  Now third time restart, had daily bonus...  But now it wants to connect to FB....  That's not happening
When a computer user gets priority updated levels ... an iPad user waits ... and waits ... and waits ... zzzzz
Very exciting!!
:)
Great game to play, but app too slow to update, please fix.
I've been playing Candy Crush Saga for ages on 3 different devices and have never used my FB account to play (because I don't want to harass my friends!!!). But now, in order to get the daily booster, it says I have to log into FB. WHY???? FB has NOTHING to do with the games I play!
I totally obsessed
Not sure what's happened with this game now. It's really slow to swipe candies. Very frustrating. I thought that there was a fault with my phone until a friend mentioned having the same problem. If it doesn't get fixed I'm deleting it. Far too annoying.
A great game I love playing just wish u could win the jackpot on the wheel it seem rigged!!  It gets very addictive!!
Love it!! Addictive though
Great game, you just can't put it down!
Love the game but connected with Facebook & it took me back to level 1 from 179. Very annoying!
Love this game. Super addictive. Is at times luck of the drop that gets you through to the next level. On lvl 433 :)
Addictive game. The latest update promises new levels but there are none! Level 650 is still the last level.
A fantastic game to keep the brain active!
Love it,, can be so anoying haha but gota keep playing
Love this game!
I'm a long time fan of Candy Crush. But the recent update is a bit of a pain, because every time I open up the app it's disconnected from Facebook and I have to manually connect it and even then it sometimes doesn't connect. It's becoming a serious pain as I want to spin the wheel to get boosters and also send my friends lives on Candy Crush but my connectivity to Facebook is really dodgy. I hope King release an update soon to fix it because it's kind of frustrating. >.<
Super addictive
good!
I love it
Can't put it down <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0083>
Very addictive, but great fun to pass time :)
Can't always connect to Facebook. The last app update is not very good.
Love it but can be so frustrating lol
Good game. Fun time
Very addictive! But I love it.
Held out as long as I could knowing I'd get addicted!!! Oh yeah now I'm a crazy candy crusher!!!
Love this game
Wondered what all the fuss was about, and then, I got hooked.  Only took about 25 seconds!
<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008A><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008A><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008A><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008A>

Nice game
Great game, extremely frustrating but really enjoyable. :)
Great fun
Very interesting
I want some power ups, some I am writing this to get some. Very addictive game, I used to have a life.
Mad about this game!
Can't get enough of this game. Even my little one likes playing it. Must download!
I still feel bad that I'm playing a game that they stole from the real inventor. I love the number of levels the different styles of levels. I am addicted I play it err day err day
Yes very addictive, has me coming back.
Hard to swipe candies now, have to swipe to or three times and end up moving wrong one.
Top game great time waster
"the coolest most addictive game, keep coming back for more, it's fun and also at times mind- blogging.
I want more!"
Great game!
Better than medicating I guess yo...
It ticks me off but I can't stop!
First
Doesn't get boring and easy to come back to after not playing for months.
Fantastic! Very addictive!!! <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00AC>
I used it to unwind after a long day
Fantastic game!!!, very addictive. Simple to use & yet still challenging as you move up the levels, so great for any age group. Love it!!
Very addictive!!!!
5stars
Love this game, spend a good deal of time trying to beat my family. Lol
Love it
:)
Very addictive and challenging . . . Love it
Easy to stop and start and turn your mind off. Good fun
Love it
What a frustratingly addictive game. Love the challenges, variation on screen layout and best of all, love the timed ones.
Such a thrilling fun game!
Pretty addictive
A+ love!
"My previous version (from July,maybe? can't tell anymore. cause it's erased, obviously) included levels up to 635.

Now that I updated to this version here, 1.35.0 - 
level 620 is the end.

Anybody else having this problem?

Apart from this hickup I love the game. 
If ""time is money"", the amount of time I spent with this app translates to some serious $$$ - transferred from my ""account"" into the developer's ""account"". Enjoy!

Would be a good idea to note the level # included in each new version announcement."
It's Awesome.
Awesome
Good fun, non stop to playing... Thank you for your effort create made this game :-)
Excellent lots of fun to play!
I love this game so much :)
Mint !
need more changes
Awesome fun and interesting way to keep your mind busy........
I play this everyday to zone out and relax.
I am so hooked on this game lol.
Love it!
Need to have lives return faster and more bonus prizes
Yay now give me three chocolate bombs
a really great time
Love this game!!!!!!!
Good little time killer <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008A>
Cool game
Great game lil bit addictive & some levels r ridiculous in expectations =/ some fun & some frustrations, lives take to long to come thro but good fun game all in all !!
Fun and addicting with a lot of content my only gripe is that you need to pay or else you wait for 24 hours for quests and stuff
Grate fun.
Love it but need more levels for candy crush app!! I prefer using the app rather than a pc because its faster and easier!! <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0089><U+263A><U+FE0F><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0083>
U guys are so slow in updates almost 22 days and still did put the new levels 1 star until u update
Great game. Easy to learn, a lifetime to master. Great for killing time ;)
Neat game and very addictive!!!!
Great game,love it!!!
I love it that you can play without spending real money, but you spend time. Up to you which you use. Its the only game I play where I can keep the sound on, those dropping candies are oddly calming to me. Fun way to kill some time.
Good
Very addicting - would like it more if the time for quests are reduced
Frustrating but fun
Can't connect to Facebook since last update and haven't been able to get my daily spin bonus because of this. have stopped playing for now :-(

Best way to waste time :-)
Great game! Never won jackpot! Some levels way too hard. Enjoyable to play!
Recently passed a staged that I've been stuck on and now my game won't sync to fb. A bit annoying. Otherwise addicting
This is a fun and easy to play and lose!!
Love this game!!
This is a great game to play, for all ages. Though sometimes it takes weeks to pass a level, which can get a bit frustrating... But when you accomplish it, you feel so smart :)
it awesome! and fun and a way to keep u busy
Really frustrating, when I do get to open a game it'll crash and I'll lose a life. Fed up.
Great fun but some of the level is toooo hard and I have to keep buying moves have to be a little easy so we don't waste money also never won the jackpot :(
Such a great game.!! Love it.
Love this game, longest I've ever played one game in my life but there are times where I get so discouraged!
Great game to play and I love it
This game is awesome
Annoyingly addictive
Enjoy the games, although think some of the levels are frustrating.  Have never won the daily jackpot....  Wonder if anybody has!
I love this game
Great game! Really fun & challenging!

Started playing Feb 2014 and now I'm on level 207 :P very addictive!! Love it! <f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008D>
Totally love this game!
I have enjoyed the game and played for many hours.  BUT there are some levels that require luck rather than skill and some where the algorithms are clearly rigged eg tornado levels 420+
Lovvvvvvve this game but can not get jackpot on daily spins why.?
Cool
Good game! Cannot stop playing that
Very addictive! :-)

Love this game
A+ game all round,
Great game
Love it tis addictive & frustratingly awesome :-)
The game is ok, but mechanics are a little heavy. There should be option to switch off the constant asking for money.
Get fun game to fill plenty if time. I've "quit" playing several times but always come back.
Awsum vry addicted now.
Addictive, amazing, awesome!
Nice
<3!!
I bombed out on level 178 and opened candy crush after a couple of hours hoping for 5 new lives but what I got was finding out I'm now on level 11. No way I'm playing again. App deleted.
Awesome. Just what you need to unwind
It's a great fun addicting game
Excellent game. Loads of fun and very addictive.
Best game to kill time
Epic game is epic
So addictive
Highly addicted! A++
Love this game but have no friends to get tickets to advance :( .
good
Updating is very slow no more levels for me to play coz I'm getting bored.  NEW LEVELS SOON thx
Perfect for filling in time.
Got lots of time? Play this
Really fun
this game is amasing, my mum loves this game soooooo much and is always playing when i dont have the ipad, she says her faverite part is the owl extra levals, her absolute fave
This game is addictive and fun. Some levels are surprisingly easy. When it comes to the quest levels, they can be remarkably frustrating, but worth it when you solve them. I think I'm hooked for the moment.
Challenging and fun.
Great game, just the right level of challenge and frustration!
Great game
Addictive and annoying (in a good way
<U+2764><U+FE0F><U+2764><U+FE0F>
Slightly addictive but it's good you have limited lives or you would spend all day playing!
"It's fun but frustrating at times I think it is a fantastic game and I love it.
Ps: very addictive"
This game is it! No game like it. Time consuming in the right way. It controls me. It gives me joy. Looooveeeee it! If there were 100 stars it would be that.
Hi, my name is Stephanie and...I'm a candy crush addict! I'm just writing a review to get th color bomb. Luv this game...please don't come up with anymore levels, I ought to get back to my life. Thanks.
Good game!
Yes candy crush has me in its powers <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0081>

Wonderfully frustratingly addictive game! Just love it.
"Very VERY GOOD game
I am very greatful that people are here to help our cravings =)
It has become an adiction
Thankyou very much all the supporters and the makers of Candy Crush .. <3"
Great time waster
Once you start you just want to keep on beating it!
This game is great! My favourite thing to do before I go to sleep at night. :)

So addictive! A great game, I love it!
Addictive!
Addictively fun game , easy to avoid the in-app purchases just need to be patient . Only gripe is that can't switch platforms without having to start at the beginning again...otherwise good fun.
Slowly getting through the levels , enjoying the game!
It's a goodie:)
Love this game. Addicted
Top app, lovin it. Would recommend to all ages.
Play it everyday. Love this game. Highly recommended A++
Good game
Good game but five lives is not enough.
Excellent game.  Has in game purchases which i hate but with perseverance and a couple of friends can get at least into the 50s levels without having to purchase anything
This is a fun game but you have to and bomb the jellies and chocolate, because where there is chocolate as soon as you get some out, there goes another chocolate in a different spot.  Cool game though.     I give it 10 stars. **********
The game always quits on me when I go to ask people for lives. Not being sarcastic by saying always but yes the game ALWAYS quits on me it pisses me off <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A3>
And highly addictive!!!
I broken my ankle two weeks ago.  I've been looking for something to pass the time.  Candy Crush is the best for that. Good variety of challenges too
Love it, love the daily spin ..best game ever
:)
Good fun, enjoyable, addictive
Cool fun pro
This game is so fun! Please make some of your computer games, e.g.-Diamond Digger, etc. into iOS games too. Looking forward to the next big update ^3^
Great game!
Once you start playing you can't stop. A great time waster for sure. Best game I've down loaded.
Loved it
Addictive... Great fun

Best game ever
Very cool game
great
I LOVE CANDY CRUSH XXOO
Love the different levels that constantly challenge me.
Totally addictive
I love this game even sometimes i'm crazy because of this game :))
Can't stop playing this
"Very addicted to it, at level 
level 50 you are not allowed to go further until you pay for it . It got you sucked in it then you either have to decide to go ahead to pay for a fortune for it or complete delete the game..."
Its amazingly fun and makes you want candy
It is additive, can be frustrating. Sometime it does random things that are either in your favour or not. I am pleased to get to levels into the 200s without paying for boosters. Not fond of the constant requests for buying - which can be switched off. not worked it out yet.
Awesome game.
Even after buying new phones I download this app and start all over again.  Only downside I find is that all the upgrades or whatever are quite expensive. $1.29 just for 5 extra moves is pretty steep imo
Enjoyable and challenging.
Addicted
Such a good game keep it up x
Fantastic time waster :)
:):)
Awesome app!
As I have written in the title. Says it all.
Love it!
Highly addictive love it.
Good game
This game is awesome, play it every day
Very additive game
You just get sucked in. If you don't buy in app purchases I don't think you can get to the end though.
So much fun
Love it
I really enjoy this because it's just the best.
Fun game and a challenge.
Great game
Games addictive
Even after installing latest version from App Store, this app takes forever to open and frequently crashes.... Often after you have made purchases. Takes way too long to load at the beginning too.
Great in all ways!
It is really good because u can send message to ur friends  on facebook and they can helps you too.
Good app
I really like this game however I don't like how much real money I have ended up spending on keys which are almost essential in the higher levels of the game.
Since I have updated it the other day ever time I load it up it just closes on me please fix I enjoy playing this game :(
Should be able to sell everything apart from that game is sublime
"Better than hay day by far! 
Love this game! 
Defos on my October lovin list <f0><U+009F><U+0092><U+0095><f0><U+009F><U+0092><U+0095>

YOU NEED THIS GAME IN UR LIFE!"
Great game :)
I enjoy playing the game, but I find that you have to have a lot of keys for certain things. So you really can't enjoy it as much as you would like.
"**WARNING** this game is highly addictive! It's a great game but as previous reviews have stated -
• very hard to get keys (unless you spend a fortune)
• very hard to complete seasonal quests due to ""special"" items being hard to come buy - no matter how hard you try
• Facebook won't connect for love or money !! 
• good co-op's are hard to find! 

Come on Zynga, your a massive company sort these issues out and it would have been a full star rating!!

Good points are it's fun, almost monotonous in a good way if you want five minutes to zone out :) 

Happy Gaming :)"
Love this game, do additive,
Decent game quite addictive still
Love this game it's very addictive and frustrating all at the same time.
I don't really like playing games but this game is different I love playing this game is the best ! Try it Out
Great game love it
Top game
is a good game!
Great game, absolutely love it! Been playing two years...but I now have trouble getting connected to the thanksgiving event! I'm online for coop and store, but I'm losing valuable time! Please help
Great game,  always lots going on to keep you interested.  Just wish they wouldn't make the events to hard to complete.  Hours of hard work and mostly impossible to achieve unless your willing to spend money on it.
Very addictive game love it
Addicted<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0082>
Love it
Spent far too much time on the first one and going the sane way with this! I'm glad this doesn't spam Facebook like the first one did though. Very addictive and keeps you playing with Special events. Very good.
Good
"I have been frozen for the last three weeks.
Please give me a reason.?"
Totally absorbing addictive game. Can't put it down! But can eat up the money as takes so long to get things you are resorted to buying keys. Very costly.
"Ya its a good time pass..best part is the ingredients take less time to be ready even harvesting takes less time which doesnt make the player feel bored to jump to someother game or make them wait till the order / harvesting is completed !
Overall its good !!"
Love this game.
I love this game and have given up all my it her farm games.  However I do think there are too many quests going at the one time plus everything comes to the same thing.....they want your money.  Nothing is free anymore.  I have been trying to get the stallion for weeks now and can't find out how to get it unless I spend a fortune for keys!!!  Otherwise it's great.
Great game, very addictive
"I really enjoyed playing this game until the new version makes it necessary to be online for it to be most accessible. Please keep,the game playable offline. Otherwise a great game. 
Can you also unlock the number of decorations we can buy. 15 fences aren't enough.
Please please can we have more animals we can buy with coins. Like geese and turkeys and ducks. Not prized animals."
Love playing the game but it forces you to buy keys. I went up to level 26 and all the items it gave me filled my shed and went well over the limit. I went and used all I could making things but I was still over.   So I bought more keys!!  My husband will kill me when he sees the statement. Surely it would be good to give something back to those that play and spend once in a while.  Also I joined a Co Op but none of them ever have anything to sell so I quit it and joined another, still the same.   Would like to see some proper rewards for the people that pay out.
Great pastime game. I love it more than...
Game is good, don't have to spend loads of money to get past things
Fun, fun, fun!!!....
It's a great game, I've really enjoyed it but a couple of days ago it stopped loading. It gets to 1% and then just sort of crashes. It's a fab game but would love it if you could get this bug fixed.
It is an okay game
I have been playing from the beginning. Yes it is a good game and addictive, but impossible to achieve quest goals unless you spend a lot of money which like myself others do not have!  So come on zynga make the game more affordable and user friendly. Surely more players who can afford the game would would be more financially viable to you!
An addictive game but agree with others the special tasks are impossible some of us have to work during the day
Play this every day for 6 months, addictive
Seriously love this game it's highly addictive , i don't buy keys and still manage to complete events and win animals etc , it's all down to your co op Ive found a lovely one with friendly helpful ppl :-)
Awesomely addictive, events are good (if a little difficult but that's why I like it) and there's so much content there's always something to do!
Very addictive!! Can't stay one day without playing, its my favourite  :)
Not a bad game but you can't really progress unless you play it every minute of every day or you spend money - neither of which I can do so it is quite frustrating
The new Fall Event is almost impossible. I was 4th one morning, by the afternoon I was 20 something. You have to put all of your time into these tasks and I don't have the lifestyle where that is possible. I prefer the tasks with the set amount of makes to progress onto each level.
Love the game
Amazing game you will have fun playing it
Really good. Sometimes can't be bothered by the wait to make stuff but I don't want to spend my keys. Lol
Just a thought how about a trade board where I ask for what I need and exchange/ sell with someone for what they need, it would go a long way completing stuff for Eagle Eye Eddie
:)
Great game although far too addictive!
Wow I love this game so much I can't describe it and iv been playing for over two years now,but the first time I played it was with my cousin and we started off with different amounts of keys.i had 90 and she had 50.i restarted the game again and that time I had 10....I don't think that's fair that everybody starts of with a different amount of keys,but that's my only complain.i recommend this game to everyone.i am so addicted
I enjoy the game but it's frustrating when you cannot complete the quests in time or without spending money.
Not as good as FarmVille 1 the original. No where near as good actually.
The game is alright to play to fill time, but it beginning to get a bit boring now, and some of the tasks are in achievable.
I love this game and so does my little gal. But few things need to change as it's not clear which card u will get from Eddie on completing the task. Make it more interesting pls
This is seriously very addictive, I have been playing daily fora few months and love it, the task are great fun to do, some like Halloween task their is no way anyone would get the cat or dog as it is just impossible unless you buy the keys. Saying that I would recommend this game to everyone as you will get hooked! It is also a great game to make new friends who can help you and you can help them.
Great game, but recently keeps telling me to sign into my facebook account, when I do it says it's already linked to another, but it's not, so there is a little issue there, but overall good game to keep u busy .
Have tried to avoid all the Facebook games for years - and now I wish I hadn't.
I like creating a perfect farm world x
Addictive
Amazing game
Need to be able to expand barn more easily.
Good game but Halloween impossible .
Ridiculous
Great game for everyone, fab when your passing some time.
Not a bad game ..
Requires too much time to play it. Doesn't always connect well so you lose some play content. Very playable though.
I am having fun to play this game. I just bought 140 keys . My purchase se completed, game closed. My purchase 140 keys lost. Please investigate this situation. It is worrying.
Just started this game today and I'm addicted!
Fun
Love the game haven't put it down yet <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0082> killing my battery I'm SOOO addicted
An amazing game and the graphics have got a lot better since the last update. If you are reading this please join the co op called the goats. We have great friends and fun.
It is a great game but, as you get further into the game it cost more money and keys which you collect in the game. It also takes longer for things to be done and crops to grow. Except for that it is a great game which I am addicted to because I love playing it!
Great game but beware its one of those games you cant help but spend a few £/$\€ on
Very good lets have another up date keep them coming
Something to kill the time with not a bad game but not a great game either
Really good game
I am buying goods from other people the money is coming of and the goods are not going into my barn
it's a good game however the quests are annoying and you don't have enough time to complete them.
The game is really good but the quests that you have to compleat are really hard to win, zynga needs to make the quests easier.
Vary nice
Love the game, its very addictive however i think the events should last longer and we should have the option to take part. Also i think we should get more keys etc
"It is a fun thrilling game that has lots to do with lots of tasks to complete , you get to visit friends and sell goods .
I love this game"
Love the game :) very addictive :)
Seriously addictive! Seriously fun! Seriously super! As things have progressed I find the events like searching for hens teeth and rocking horse droppings to add to the needle I found in the virtual haystack. Glad to hear I'm not the only one who can't complete them. Sometimes the coop goes off line and there's never much to buy from them anyway.
Really enjoy playing this, although the quests are almost impossible to complete unless you can play constantly.
Love it new addiction
The only way to get a dog, cat or other special animals is to have keys and I have been playing the game for months now and I still have only 20 keys. To get a dog I need 400! The only way to get a special animal is to buy keys which are really expensive for the amount on offer.  Playing the game is impossible to gets the amount of keys needed to obtain special animals. Making the game boring. The challenges are set to get money from us! If you are willing to pay loads of money to get the animals you want go ahead and get game. But I won't recommend this game to anyone.
Very addictive game.  I would have given more stars however, my in app purchases never arrived and looking at the forums, this is happening to many players.  The contact pages are non existent so bad on you Zynga Inc.  I will be deleting the game on principle.
Fantastic game very addictive and very friendly people helping when playing the game!
Great game very addictive the only hitch I had was when I completed the first event and got the golden retriever dog and the game froze and I lost him and never got him back and he was useful such a shame
This is a very fun game.I like it!<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008F>
I don't really know what I'm doing but I can't seem stop playing this game!!!!
Love it
Quicker paced...much better than waiting HOURS
The game is cool. very good graphics. I love it.
Totally love this game!
"Keeps going offline despite my tablet clearly showing I am online. I can browse stuff on my tablet yet FarmVille refuses to accept the connection :( this wouldn't be so frustrating if it were not for activities such as the one at the moment <grrrrr>

Not impressed."
"I do love playing this game but i find that it is really slow a lot of the time. It is sooooo hard to get gold and silver and also on events if you are not on the game for most of the day you always lose out on prizes.
Not sure i would recommend it."
If you like FarmVille then you will like FarmVille 2, it's much better than the first
Good game
keeps saying I'm offline and not connected when I am. how am I supposed to get gold in the events?? fix please! <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A0>
Very addictive good game :)
The characters are cute but it can be a bit manic at times. Like a lot of games it is obviously a money spinner as it is impossible to get far without spending, plus not much good if you aren't on Facebook.
I enjoy playing this game and I've shown my children how to play this game n they enjoy it
This game is brilliant and very enjoyable ! <f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008D><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0083>
Great game and very addictive! Be warned - don't download unless you have time to spare!
Great to play with the family
Keys are too expensive but it's a fun game none the less
Really fun and totally addictive
Good as these games go it is possible to play without having to buy keys
Addictive
Lots of fun,
Fun game
Waiting time for crops is far too long. The game constantly lags or crashes. Keys are way overpriced. Not enough room for everything so more land needs to be available to open. If i could score minus i would. <f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008E><f0><U+009F><U+0092><U+00A9>
"I like this games however the quests can be impossible to complete especially the hallowe'en one, which can make the game a little boring! 

At the moment I'm having trouble viewing my coop, I can't see everyone and when I request a helping hand it disappears so Is a waste. I can see from your list of bugs that this is a mown issue but is not yet getting fixed, when will it be fixed as it is really effecting my game play?"
Just far too addictive!
Great game
Love this game! So addictive
Great fun
Great game, i love it play it on my iphone all the time,
But yes echoed by so many others you can't complete the events which is annoying
Addictive game and fun, but they should really remove the sold out items.  The boards are littered with them.
Great game, just would be nice if I actually received half the keys that I have paid for!
Brilliant game cant stop playing it
I have no problem with the game and I enjoy playing it
The tasks are not achievable without spending fortunes
Very good game, enjoyable to play but can become addictive.
Awesome game has to be 5/5!
10/10 love it
Good game
Very addictive
I really enjoy the game and don't mind the repetitiveness of the game. But I get frustrated by the fact that my barn gets full so quickly and  it takes so much time to get the things to upgrade without spending so much money. I find that it takes a long time to load and too much of my bandwidth at times. Overall it is fun.
Great game
I love it - just like the originals - it's so addictive but whenever I try to buy from friends farms it's saying everything sold or bought.  This is only since the Autumn thingy started
Highly addictive but very frustrating
Addictive
Mastery seals are given & credited but when you make the item no recognition. 2 Apple pies & Brie lost. Frustrating. Also have sold products eg 2teddy Bears + other things that are not counted in extra quests. Cannot log onto game centre. I also followed on Twitter but did not receive the speed seed. It keeps telling me I'm off-line but I have Internet access & have not disconnected it!
I'm having problems with the new update. When i want to access to the Thanksgiving challenges it days that i'm not connected... And I am! Please could you check it??
Now it's a total mare. Keeps freezing and is unusable. I'm very close to deleting it and I'm at a high level. PLEASE sort this out. ASAP.
Very addictive but Halloween event was very difficult and others may be too.
Very addictive game really enjoyable only prob,is not enough time to get order completed but other than that brilliant
I was most impressed to see keys available on missions and sale of goods. I only have one gripe now and that is timing on missions, these really need to be longer. Great extras now though
"Very innocent and sweet game.
It's addictive and friends can't give you speed seeds to help things along."
Love it
I do like this game but the events that they set up are impossible to complete. The Halloween one was particularly annoying - even a friend who plays it constantly couldn't complete it. Don't mind things being difficult or a challenge but impossible is just boring!! I also get very tired and frustrated with the game lagging - which has caused me to sell, farm or even throw away valuable items accidentally. It is a real shame!!
Really enjoyed playing "HayDay" but this is even better. Fab
It's a cute game with small and big objectives some more challenging than others and regular exciting events with great prizes easy to achieve.
I do enjoy playing this game. However the quests are only achieved by buying keys to speed things up. Too many bronze tokens are given, we need more silver and gold.
Love this game but soo addictive time just slips away when playing<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0080><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008A><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0080>
Good game be nice to get stuff
"Excellent Game. 
Interesting. Challenging. 
Addictive. 
Be your own boss on your very own farm."
Great that you taken notice and making it easier to get hale well done :) this makes the game more enjoyable , glad you learnt from the Halloween task was a joke, keep up the good work great game :)
Fab
"Can no longer play on I pad, I phone or I pod since last update- keeps closing down without warning. 
Really annoyed & will delete app if it's not fixed soon."
Really enjoy the games, though the challenges (for me) are impossible!
"This app is great but with the autumn update I can't do anything as it says that I'm not connected and that theirs no wifi  but I have  3 bars 
So frustrating"
Fab game
Game is fun,however the little guy with the trailor that changes requests every four hours is a pain since some of the items take 6-8 hours to make. I also notice it is harder to upgrade the barn over the silo. Events are fun but they happen too often and they interrupt game play I don't like harvesting an item and getting something else with it and taking up space in storage which is short as it is. I do not purchase anything on this game and I don't have problems working things in but event items take up too much space or time to move it out of storage. Otherwise fun game I enjoy it. The events are interesting. I really love that I can send items from my iPad or phone to my laptop farm on Facebook. I send whatever the other  farm needs in just a min. Usually I have water supply issues on my Facebook farm on laptop so I send it from the iPad. Then I send wool from the laptop to iPad. Love getting fertiliser from visiting friends and extra help from co op.
I keep having to log in and out of facebook in settings for the game to give me my friends back!
Brill game, loads to do
Best game I've ever played
Still some bugs that need sorting
Some of the animals are too hard to get (cats & dogs), additional keys are expensive & event things take too long to complete.
To complete any quest you have to be on the game 24/7. I bought a trunk of keys and never received them. Fortunately, I will be reimbursed the money taken from my account. It is however, very addictive and the graphics is quite good
<f0><U+009F><U+008C><U+009F><f0><U+009F><U+008C><U+009F><f0><U+009F><U+008C><U+009F><f0><U+009F><U+008C><U+009F><f0><U+009F><U+008C><U+009F><f0><U+009F><U+008C><U+009F>
I love this game but the events have been coming a bit too quick. You should also have the option not to participate in an event when you like so that you are not continuously hassled with event crops popping up when you don't want them. The other option could be not play for an event time period I suppose which is a shame.
Me and my sister have suddenly got obsessed with this game<f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008F><f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008F><f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008F>its so good<U+2764><U+FE0F>would recommend to anyone<f0><U+009F><U+008C><U+00B8>
Good game. Frequent updates.
I love this game! So addictive! Shame you don't get more keys for completing tasks!!
Better then FarmVille....... Love the game
Fab game am so addicted
How can I be 6 in the leaderboard and suddenly drop to 25? About to delete as this is the second time this has happened to me.
This game makes me can't stop, pretty complicated beginning, overall can't stop to play. :-)
It's just great. A peceful adventure into food-producing system. Totally kind and happy!
Great game, passes the time away, with loads to do, very clever, things to achieve, to earn money..
Highly addictive
It's an addictive and lovely game. I love the often events. Highly recommended.
I have had this app for a few months now and have loved it, but the last 3/4 days, it's been crashing every time i open it ... pls, pls, pls sort this out, cos i really don't want to delete it!!
It's really good
Fun game that keeps me entertained while quiet at work

Keeps me occupied for ages. Highly addictive.
Low maintenance and loads of fun. Found the wait times bearable and the progression of the farm at a steady pace only thing wrong is the speed you get your quests seems a little overwhelming at the start
Good game and highly addictive but would prefer more options on sales board - always seems to be the same things - would also like to know when mariner is being unlocked cause looks like will be good addition to the game
I love this game but the only problem is the sales board, You don't get a variety of options, At the min all I'm getting is grapes and pears and I used to get a variety of options, please can you fix this!!
Fab! Very addictive.
Love this game the only bad thing I would say is that key are sooo hard to get
Brilliant wee game very addictive I think the xp could be a little bit more
Brilliant game even if a bit addictive so the Mrs says <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0089>
"I enjoy playing the game, but find a lot of repeat quests etc. I do the Eddie quests and now have over 20 bronze medals but only few gold and silver. How do I get more of these. Also very difficult to complete the Halloween quests. Keep lucking out getting the specials. None at the glade and not always at mine. 
The game does not always connect with Facebook either so where are my friends? 
The game can be improved in lots of little ways. Come on Zyinga get your act together."
Brilliant but needs improvement on the co-op side of things!
I really enjoy it crazy at my age
... Needs some improvements with the timing of getting stuff ready... Doesn't help if you have an order to fulfill in 2hrs but the items will take 6hrs to make... Other than that the game is fun!
Fab game but can be very stressful so lack of sleep due to task
A great time waster, it's a shame it's doesn't update quicker on the selling board.
As with most of these the constant need to harvest personal information irks me, and it does sell, but you can enjoy a free anon game quite nicely.
really good, challenges are hard but it's really addictive to Wanna complete them <f0><U+009F><U+0099><U+0088>
Can't seem to put this game down. Easy to follow, great way to pass the day away, just totally brilliant
"I do like this game (but did not rate it due to getting very frustrated with the  events) 
I do find that you can get quite far along, then near the end they slow down and you cannot get the last few items to complete the task. 
I know it's aimed at getting you to purchase keys to finish the event but does make you less likely to play and take part."
Really enjoying this game.
Fab game. Only problem is the limit to what your barn will hold and that you have to spend money to upgrade
Great, fun game with plenty to do :0)
I love this game. It's very fun and satisfying. There are lots if challenges. Lots of things you have to make. Love the graphics too. BUT NOW AT LEVEL 28 AND IT JUST CRASHES ALL THE TIME. CANT EVEN OPEN IT.  ALL THE TIME AND MONEY I SPENT AND IT'S BROKEN.
After the update cant open app stick at 1% loading... So i am o longer playing for 2 days...
Doesn't work. My farm has combined with another persons meaning nothing works, I can't collect anything from grandmas glad or prized animals etc.
Good
Wish it wouldn't keep freezing so often and more people could join the co-ops..... It is highly addictive though
I have updated the game so I get the latest event but it has not appeared in the game
"There was never going to be enough time to complete this task with out spending real cash.
Took far too long to get items you need that's if you got them after sending all you farm hands to do one task. As well as having to wait 2days between each costume. I really don't think I will keep playing if its going to stay so unfair. One really sad farmer ready to hang up my farm!!!"
FarmVille 2 is a great game, But like any game has it's faults. This game is really easy too use although the higher the level the more time it takes too build stuff such as: Barns, Houses, Sheds. I just got this game today and I have reached level four or five already. Although I would love to reach level 16+ because of Eagle Eyed Eddie and the Ribbon store. The improvement you could of made is you could of made them things start level 10+. No glitches that's good and the buildings do not start too take a long time till higher levels. But should stay 30seconds.
So upset that YOU made it impossible to get the Halloween cat!!!!!
I have to totally agree with the earlier review that the Haloween task is a complete joke! It takes 8 hours to get 2 cocoa beans and all you get is rubbish this task will be impossible to complete without spending money! In 4 days I have gone up one place towards getting the cat ... Terrible!! I have loved this game up to this point but really think I may delete the app.. Wasting my time. I would normally give this game 5 stars but due to this ridiculous Haloween event I am giving it 1 star. App is now deleted due to the ridiculous Haloween task wasting so much time and still no cat
"Great game until the tasks came along, the only chance you have of completing them is to throw loads of money at the game or have zero going on in the rest of your life! 
Missed the Halloween cat by 2 parts because you can't start the next section until a certain day unless you pay, then when you do get going what is the reward for you time and effort - Granola bars and pan fries! Pretty poor really!"
I have found your Halloween quest nigh on impossible to complete. Finished 2 parts had to wait 27 hours before starting next part. Then took to long to acquire needed items to complete 3rd & 4th parts of quest, then get to the final bit with 2 hours remaining!! How on earth do u expect people to finish these quests? Totally ridiculous and won't do anymore!
"I found this game very enjoyable.  Only down  side,is that it crashes sometimes when trying to do a few things at once.
The events are very hard to complete unless willing to buy extra, therefore costing money if you want to complete them."
They are too complicated and hard to collect event items please resolve this problem certain animals take longer than mist and out off all events I've completed 3 it's too frustrating u need to alter length off time for animals pond pier and blueberrys peaches ect
Please extend the game so you can get beyond level 60. Otherwise a great game.
Takes too long to get items even though I play every day.
Avoid it like the plague the Halloween event is virtually impossible to do!
I love this game and check it nearly every few hours and the love the themed challenges but I get a little bit annoyed that the final stage to getting the reward is SO difficult!
Was working brilliantly then the technical glitches started and now I'm finding it incredibly frustrating. The costume event has been fun but it's virtually impossible to finish. That's disappointing. Think this game is likely to have a short interest shelf life here.
Love this game and got all my friends playing it! Although lately it hasn't been connecting to Facebook
I use to love this game but it's too hard to complete the special events. Sort it out for 5 stars please!
"I started playing this game on facebook then got the app. The thing that bugs me the most is when you collect all the things for the aeroplane the quicker you do it you should get gold but so many times I've done this and I've got bronze its pants!!! 
The rest of the game is very good just that little thing."
Where is my keys????? I bought 140 keys and i didn't get it. Grrrr im angry
Seems to be a glitch two farms have been combined and one can no longer be used in co op
"I loved this game, it was completely addictive. Unfortunately you cannot complete the Halloween event without spending any real money.

It's very frustrating and considering deleting the game. Thank you very much greed greedy Zynga"
I was really getting into this game then the glitches started, it would just shut down on ipad taking me back to home screen, so I stopped playing. Then I started again a couple of months ago and it has been fine, but over the past few days the glitches have reared their ugly heads again, really annoying as one minute I'm playing then it's gone, can't get anything done, and it's started running slow, when you try to look around your farm or click on things nothing happens, it freezes up then all of a sudden it will work for a second or two, or it just shuts down.. Sort it out please or you'll be losing another player
I do love this game.....But in true Zynga style they make the missions impossible!! Starting to find is quite frustrating. I'm wondering if they are hoping I will spend money to finish these missions?! Come on make it more playable & less frustrating to play Zynga!
I love to think about the animals and get the milk fresh
Really enjoying this game <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008A>
Love this game!!
I love this game I'm always playing it .
Great game but the hallowe'en mission is cery hard to complete
It's a good multi level game
Addictive but I always jump when my phone moos.
Very disappointed that Halloween event is unachieveable if you don't have money to buys keys. Love playing the game but need to make is possible to finish. Had 5 days to get cat outfit, but after 2 days and 5 treat bags no outfit parts. Will run out of time and feel very frustrated and disappointed that time spent on game has been in vain. Having delays between each animal was a con and choosing lemon trees which take 10 hrs to grow makes it worse. This is supposed to be fun. People will leave game if this carries on. Please try the event before posting.
I really enjoy playing this game but I think they should spend more time fixing pre existing glitches rather than keeping introducing new stuff
Great game ready enjoy playing
Loved this game in the beginning but getting frustrated with it. Unless you want to play 24/7 then you can't get very far after level 17. Then it's not fun anymore. I like a game to be challenging but this is becoming a bore
I am going to delete this app as soon as I have given all my goodies away.  It cynically manipulates you into parting with cash by making the challenges harder as you go through the levels.  The Halloween task finally decided me...goodbye Zynga.
Addictive!!!!!!!!
Good
Brill little game
"It's a great game for the family and very addictive !!!

Lavz It!"
Love this game, only find it's difficult to complete some of the tasks on time.
Addictive game. I love playing it but my coins and keys keep disappearing. I haven't used them, spent them or tapped on them. Very annoying, when you work hard to earn them then they disappear. Why does this keep happening?
I love this game but I must admit it has it's fault like some of the equipment you need costs 200,000 and 400,000 things should be cheaper and also silver and hold tickets should be easier to get from eagle Eddie, also it takes 8 hours to fish which is too long to get all the Halloween outfits done and I'm really determined to get the black cat but I have three days to do it in! I only have one costume left to collect, but I think once you've made the Halloween party bags you should receive a part of the costume not just granola bars and pumpkins and hardly ever get the costume parts but other than that it's brilliant and addictive game!
I love this game but sometimes it crashes which is frustrating. Also find the cost of expanding and buying new items expensive
Oh my god. This app is so annoying I got addicted to this game and got up to level 53 and now I can't get onto the app because when I click on it it loads up and goes back onto the home screen. DONT GET IT. 1 STAR
The game is brilliant except that the events are too hard! You don't have enough time to finish everything unless you buy keys and NOT EVERYONE wants to. It's a joke. Fix it or people will get fed up and leave.
Good game
A good game, with plenty to keep you busy. Most games I've played, you do a few tasks, then you have to go do something on another game. This one, you can stay, chat within your co-op, help gather or produce items for them.
This is a really enjoyable and fun game!!
It's a very simple and fun game you'll be so happy I bet you'll never regret it<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0087>
Really enjoy playing this game, love the themes they have, i.e Halloween. It's not difficult to play and can be enjoyed by all ages.
This game is amazing! I love it and have been addicted to it for months now! It's really fun to play especially when events are on and you have a chance to win prizes. Sometimes the game does crash but this seems to be fixed every time there is an update. To me it's one of the best games out there and one of the best farm games.
Special event items are very hard to complete unless your playing the game 24/7!!!
I enjoy the game but sometimes I get very frustrated at how tedious it is. Same things over and over. Also the storage thing is pathetic and extremely annoying to say the least. So easy to use keys accidentally and then of course you have to purchase keys etc!
There is much room for improvement, my kids have got bored as the game is slow at achieving and building, everything is expensive. The game it's self is great but needs to move on at a better pase.
"With just 3 days to go, it's pretty obvious that the black cat will never be mine! The sacks of cocoa beans are as elusive as the Scarlet Pimpernel. 
I feel robbed!"
Good game I enjoy playing it and hope to continue playing this fun game
Lovely game. I just can not leave it alone!
Amazing can't stop playing me and my boyfriend find very addictive
The game is great if you want to relax and chill. The special tasks are long and take an age to complete . It encourages you to purchase keys in which to complete the task faster. The coops are cool as long as everyone plays fair... This does not always happen and people steal goods that we meant for you...It can get nasty . Some coops are a little extreme and will throw you out it you don't have a photo of you on the game. It's an addictive game but don't get strung out on the tasks... They could cost your money and your morals. Beware of extreme coops.. Get out while you can..
This game is great I like it so much
Very addictive game especially when you have the contests. Does take time to craft a few things but on the whole a great game. Current Halloween contest is frustrating as you it takes too long to craft lemons to get ingredients you need. You need to spend lots of money on this event to win. Not impressed with this one so giving up on event as won't win and not spending anymore money! Please sort it as otherwise a really great game.
Fghjjjnn<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008E><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008E><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008E>
Love this game, so addictive.
I've been playing for a number of months now and finally the events impossible to complete so it is gradually losing its appeal... It's a pity as I enjoy this farming game though the original PC version FarmVille was just superb though eventually the ads got too much
Seems to be good fun, only on level 10 though!
This game is really addictive but some things take too long or aren't easy to get like keys or you have to be a certain level to expand.
A lot of patience required
Excellent!!!
Great game apart from crashing and taking so long to receive treats... Been on last one for 3 days and nothing yet!!
"Only annoying thing is it takes too long to do the special tasks, unless you have lots of keys and they are few and far between.
I love the game though"
I love this game, have been playing for many months, I like that there are more events to do! But frustrated with the halloween one <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+009E>
Great game but you can't do the same game on Facebook
Very addictive
This is the best game ever.
Awesome game love it!!!! <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+009C>
I have loved playing this game but I'm really disappointed with the Halloween event. It is impossible to complete without spending money on add ons which I don't want to. Time to look for a new game <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0094>
Love this game!!
Love it
Have enjoyed playing this game but have had a couple of times when I have been locked out for weeks.  Better now though.  However, the Halloween game is driving me mad.  It is so difficult to get the cocoa beans. Hours and hours of trying but they rarely appear.  I have spent money but no more, it has become a con to make people spend and the number of keys required to get a cat is ridiculous.  After this Halloween game I will not do any more, way too frustrating.
The game is really good but to improve it you could slow down how meant quests u get I think this could but done by to quests at a time and then when there down another two <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008A>
Love it .. So addictive . Spent hours playing and chatting with some great people
This games is good and relaxing to play and keeps you busy.
Addictive and fun
Good game but spending money to complete things that you have obviously made too hard to do anyway if it gets no easier I will be deleting the game
"This game requires a lot of patience before you get a reward. But getting a reward is satisfying. I like the various different objects that can be made and the co op is a great idea.

Problems:

1. You work hard on quests to get keys only to accidentally use them when harvesting crops. Please can we have a confirmation box.

2. The set challenges for example the current Halloween challenge is pretty impossible without spending money. Even when you work hard and collect all the items you need you open your trick or treat bag to find anything but the part of costume that you set out to find.

3. You work hard to get all the items for Eddie to earn the stamps just to find another bronze stamp - where are all the gold ones???

4. Tending prized animals is supposed to give you ribbons. Their value is limited because it is unusual to get a blue badge and there is nothing much you can do with a red badge. Yellow badges are good for buying nails though.

Overall good fun game but needs a good few improvements."
I like it very much :)
Great fun game
a nice cool game .
U love farm ok
Unless you have all the time in the world to play this game 24/7, you have no chance to complete task, ie halloween, 21 days to do task, lost  2 days just waiting for next task to start,.
Love this game
If you have the time, it's a good game, the app works perfectly, the only trouble I've had is it's ability to keep connected to the internet even though wifi is connected.
I throughly enjoy this game, if your in the right coop it's even better as people are willing to help each other succeed. I have however had a few problems with loading and seeing chat etc which I do feel needs to improve as I know I'm not the only one. Also I am finding the recent halloween event very difficult!! Which I do feel is a bit unfair!! All other events have been fun and not overly difficult, this one is very far fetched and frustrating. I do feel that this could put people off playing the game so needs to be addressed!
Agree about the Halloween task, I can't afford to keep buying keys so this one looks set to be a no go
Temperamental, highly unstable app. I would give only one star if I could. Done.
I really enjoy playing this game but it is very frustrating trying to complete the various special tasks - you need to make it easier to get the required items or people will start to get bored and move on to another game - too many tasks going on at once - don't know which one to do first as can't do all and hope to win the extra animals etc !
The hallowe'en game is to difficult have been trying for two days to get coffee beans sent to the pond past two nights no luck lost interest now
A great game to play with my 8 month old daughter. She loves it plus it sends her to dreamland after a few minutes.
It's a good game, entertaining and creative but it's a game where you have to wait for things
So addictive and fun to play! I love this game. The challenges make it fun and keeps you busy!
Cute fun and addictive!
A lovely game...but... some of the events/tasks are unobtainable, you get so far then they become harder and that's when you feel it's a complete waste of time if you don't shell out money to finish the rest of the task/event. Very frustrating! <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A0>
Love this game used to play it on the laptop. But now it's on iPad it's better
Addictive
Awesome
This game can be very addictive try not a attend the farm for a day impossible
Awesome game i cant stop playing it.
Fun to play and socialise, however things are very expensive & can be annoying!
Great game!!!!! I like that I don't have to buy anything to move on in the game.
I hate the Halloween challenge. The cocoa beans took hours to get and when I have enough to make the chocolate bar, all I got was the basic items as a prize, the prizes I need to finish the challenge.  Also I'm finding that the boost option is a waste of coins.  I get nothing extra when it's active.
I find this game a nice way to wind down and it's great to have a task to do but not ones that are virtually impossible unless you are farming all day every day.  Be fair makers otherwise this farmer is going on strike and looking for another pastime !!
Lots of fun
Enjoying this game only thing is when the game shuts down on its own, but it's a great game
Good game
Great game, fun to play with the kids!
Very good game
FarmVille 2 is the best game in a long time for me and is always keeping me occupied
Very addictive only downside is it's very hard to collect special items to complete missions. Always just miss out at the very end :(
Great game but trying to find needed ingredients is a nightmare, never completed one yet an won a dog or cat! I liked this on laptop but now laptop gone miss a lot of the features of the original game!
has some minor glitches and a little slow if you don't spend money...but still very enjoyable....
This game is soooo addictive you'll need to leave your phone connected to the mains because your battery will not last long once you get drawn in.
On all the devices in my family this game has excelled and is me and my brothers favourite game! So addictive and so fun and if u don't have it … What r u waiting for!!!!<f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008D><f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008D><f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008D><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0083><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+009C><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+009D>
Very addictive game, but it is only with the help of a good co-op, and selfless players, that some tasks can be completed.  Now got 100 stamps, nothing to use them on, new mastery challenge is way too frustrating, and having to restart device regularly to speed up chat is ridiculous.  Been playing for ages, nearly level 60, so will plateau at that. What next?
Very addictive and great fun to play, just a shame it keeps crashing
Enjoy playing
Makes you want to keep playing it over and over!
I have had hours of fun playing and love the additional tasks but I have found the Hallowe'en tasks very frustrating. You make the first tasks fairly easy to complete (especially if, like myself, you buy keys etc) but you really cannot expect us all to keep on spending lots of money just to complete it. I thought will 12 days to go I would be able to finish it and claim the cat but no it seems impossible and that is a great shame. So please give something back to all of us gamers or you may find fewer people will want to play.
"I'm on level 33 and it's not quick getting there but I can't see myself getting bored of it any time soon. There is in-app purchases but Iv got this far without having to buy anything like seeds or keys.
Great wee game :)"
Such a shame that this game has been spoiled by the latest "Halloween" event. The event is a blatant attempt by the developers to extract money from players by making it virtually impossible to complete without spending a silly amount of real money. Craftily the designers keep you hooked until the penultimate stage of the event whereupon I would imagine it is easier to find the Turin shroud or the Holy Grail than a cocoa bean in FarmVille land.
Enjoying game but frustrated by size of barn. Very difficult to earn necessary bits to expand it & expansion only gives you 10 more spaces. No option to buy extra storage. Halloween tasks no way I'm gonna finish them in time powdered milk too rarely appears
Addictive game, I love my little farm! :)
Just like to say really love the game! But the current Halloween task is going to be impossible to complete! I almost think the developers think/believe we all have no lives & therefore can be on this app 24/7. Please please please make future tasks at least achievable to some degree without having to either spend money or precious  time on a hiding to nothing!
Loving this game lots of activities to complete but Halloween activity is slow to pick up goodies
"I love this game but it can be pretty frustrating.
The current quest (Halloween) is impossible to finish unless you pay real money. 
You have to do the mine, pond etc to get an ingredient but it takes between 2 and 8 hours to complete only to NOT get the ingredient. I cannot  play the game 24 hours a day or pay real money so it's pretty annoying."
Game is addictive ;-)
I love this game. I'm always on it. So fun and addictive. Some of the tasks are hard to complete but that's what makes it more challenging
Topnot game:)
Usually love the game but the last Halloween event seems to be impossible can never get the special items u need from ye prized animals and grandmas glade etc
Great game. Very addictive
Really good fun and highly addictive
Brilliant great fun.
What a great game
Excellent game. Takes a while to complete tasks sometimes though due to lack of resources e.g. Coins
Really enjoyed playing this game until now, can't get any clothing items for cat, don't have a chance now of getting any, have millions of pounds but nothing to spend it on why can't we buy items with coins instead of having to get keys. really disappointed seriously thinking of deleting this game.
Love it there's loads to do x
Totally addictive
This game is fun and addictive but wish they would make it easier to upgrade the barn storage as it get full very quick
Highly addictive but great fun...however tasks (Halloween etc) are time consuming and expensive if you want to finish them on time.!
There is not enough storage space think they should have separate silo
I like this game very much. Very exciting and challenge .
I even play when should be sleeping
I love this game. It's brilliant but I have got to a point where I am at level 40 and can't get anything else except animals and land. Needs an update for things like new crops and new challenges. But the themed challenges actually need to be more feasible. I have got some cocoa beans but nowhere near completing it. It's like dangling a lump of steak in front of a lion but just to high for them to reach. It's cruel.
Very addictive .. Excellent game.. Bad for battery life tho ... Can't put it down... Great to while away the hours..
Love this game but loading issues are getting worse I spend a lot of time and money for keys but most of the time can't get onto the coop board and I miss things I need to buy please sort this out I will be disappointed if I have to delete
Really good app so entertaining
I love the game <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0098><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0098><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0098><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0098><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0098><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0098><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0098><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0098><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0098><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0098><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0098><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0098>
Took me ages to collect the items for the event but when i finished it never gave me the horse
A great game if Zynga could ever resolve all the bugs in the game. If the game was a car, it would be sold for scrap.
Passes the time nicely
It's good
Great game but Halloween event is to difficult to achieve having big trouble to get coca  it's impossible to get taken 5 days and only got one costume part so far , other game players having the same trouble need to fix as I think I will stop playing as it frustrating and costly feel like u just want us to spend lots of money on the game
Great Game i play every day
This game is great until you try and complete the events. These are a shameless way to try and make you spend cash. I refuse to take part in events and simply play the rest of the game. Come on guys give us at least half a chance if you are going to develop the events
"Great game very addictive. Love playing it. Very addictive and sometimes annoying when your store is full otherwise great fun and you never know what's coming next.
Am having problems with FarmVille cannot connect to Facebook excellent game. Please could you let us purchase dogs and cats with money not keys. It would make it much more fun and keep everybody suing this addictive game. More challenges!"
Awesome
Highly addictive but slow once you've progressed.
It's a great game, easy to use and is so much fun. I would definitely recommend it!
Love playing <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0083>
As been said already, nothing more than a blatant rip-off by makers. I am disgusted by this, that they should use the game to extort real cash out of fans. I have only just been able to keep up til I came up to the pig costume. To get just one step along the path, the cocoa beans are soooo hard to get hold of, I am using keys. Lots of them... in the hope I could complete but I have now woken up. What the hell was I doing. Wasting what would have been a lot of money for a black cat. Enough. If I were you I'd stop too
Like other reviewers, I am pretty disgusted that - having worked very hard collecting party bags, and paying for things in the process in order to fairly support the developers - I have got to collecting cocoa beans and it is simply impossible. Even sending six farm hands to the big lake AND paying 2225,000 coins for a boost(!) produced no cocoa beans. Come on, developers. It's a two way street. If people support you with in app purchases, the very least you can do is make a given task achievable. Difficult is fine, but impossible is not.
Great game apart from the 'specials' that seem impossible to complete.
Think original FarmVille was better, but only played this for half hour. It'll grow on me! Lol. Since recent update wing connect to Facebook !
I like this game.....
I enjoy playing on this game. Hate waiting for things to grow or be built but I guess not we would all complete it too quick
Good that you can play off line. Wish you could get keys a bit easier or more frequently though. Highly recommended
It would be nice to get more key s but I like the game very much
I love the game, and the challenges , but it's got to the point , they are making the Halloween challenge very difficult to finish .. People do work , and I been trying to get this pig costume for a week now.. I am about to delete the game for good.. People do have school and work. I work a full time job and I alway on this game , challenges are meant  to be fun, but not to the point where you feel fed up ..
I love the game but I have to agree, I feel the halloween event likes others, is impossible unless you spend real money which is ludicrous when your trying to win a free cat! I understand it needs to be challenging but this feels like a fraud!
Excellent game
Great fun
Love this game, pure and simple.
Unable to connect to FB and now having someone else's farm bug. Halloween challenge is a joke <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A4><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A0> !!!
Enjoying playing game but can't afford keys
Good addicting game ?!!
Halloween task in possible to do. I just about finished the last task.
Use to love this game but it's becoming a joke now. Ask for people to send me a helping Hand and when they help me no one else appears on my farm and has been doing this for the past few days so I'm missing out. And I can only see my friends on co-op so cant buy from anyone else. And the new Halloween event is a joke send all my people to the pier for 4hours and when it's finished i dont even get any cocoa bean so how do u expect us to complete the event. You need to sort the game out before a lot of people unistall the app.
What's wrong now in the middle of the event it says for update and it doesn't do it it's stuck
Great game but loads my game centre achievements every time I load the game #annoying
"Loved FarmVille 2 but.........
They keep changing it!!!
Frustrating or what ???!!!!!"
Love the game, lots to do and keeps me occupied. Think the keys are way too expensive, don't like having to lose all if clearing out the barn  and would prefer the challenges to be realistic to achieve. Upgrade items are very rare and this leads to stagnating or having to spend money to upgrade, not good.
Love this so addictive :)
I was enjoying the game but the events are impossible unless you dont work and can play 24/7 or you spend loads of cash on ridiculous amounts of keys! Im starting to get bored and will end up stopping and deleting if continues like this, takes forever to increase levels and costs a fortune to buy new things
Ok so far :) not the same as the original FarmVille but as that's not available anymore this will have to do lol
The game is good and addictive needs plenty of time to play
Most lovely game ever played
Just loaded new update.....now it loads then aborts while trying to connect to the network. Come on zynga get it right. This is a great game, just all too often not playable!
Brill x
Good time filler.
If you want a deep plot look elsewhere but if you want an addictive little time filler then this is for you.. Be warned, you'll keep coming back for more!
This game is brill love it
This game is addictive
Funny
Brill
this is a interesting game for those that dream of being a farmer
So far so good I've only jut started playing to glitches yet
Very good game
Great game
Plenty of challenges. Only down side some challenges are impossible to complete. Items you need never appearing.
Can't put it down great fun
Once I downloaded this game I was addicted. I enjoy playing however once you get to the higher levels the game becomes predictable and slightly boring. The recent tasks are great however unachievable,especially Halloween task  and with all of these games if you want the cool stuff real money has to spent. Developers you need to sort this otherwise you'll have a game no one will play for long.
Constantly crashes and impossible to complete the events , and why do you not reply to any of these reviews ......disappointed .
I really enjoy playing the game.  Aspects I enjoy are building up the farm, trying to achieve tasks, sending items between the iPad and the mac to supplement items. I don't get all the items I have to send to farm and vice versa.  The tasks are only achievable if you play an awful lot and try and anticipate what might come up.  I like that the items for pairings don't have a time limit.  Tips - once Eddy in the plane leaves, click on the runway and there's a hint as to what he will be looking for next time. I agree that the expansion for the barn and achieving tasks is hard without paying a lot of money. 400 keys for the dog is, comparatively, not a lot of money but it all builds up. I haven't been able to get the fertiliser and can't transfer it from my mac farm. The ability to buy with coins from others is what helps me achieve the tasks when u do. That is really good and I like that the items for sale change every five minutes.  Overall a great addictive game, say to rack p u to achieve tasks and wastes a lot of my time. Too much, really.the events that appear, come up too often, to have any chance to succeed you have to send your farmhands to the lake, flushing pier, mine or tend prized animals. Harrell get an ingredient from roused animals, mist times get one from the mine and I keep sent farmhands there and to fishing pie, all take time though. Can rack up costs and do end a fortune. I'd like to be able to send made goods from main farm to country escape other than butter wool, I'd Lind to send wine, bottles etc to help with tasks.
Fab game
Excellent game. Can't take my eyes off the screen!
Loving the game. Haven't been able to put my phone down. I'm loving the co-op
"I love the game . But too many bugs or glitches makes it frustrating. 
The new mastery seals are hard to complete as it will not allow you to finish the orders.
May have to delete if not sorted as what's the point in playing really. 
Need to listen more about what people are saying"
Love the game, very addictive. The events are easy then become near impossible unless you buy keys which are very expensive.
Great game
Never enough room in storage can only play 10 min at a time, before lack of storage pisses me off lol not as good as FarmVille
Sooooo addictive can't stop playing day and night love it
Really enjoying this very addictive game
"My days' what a cute and clever game! It's in-game options go on and on.....
Vibrant and cute fun for all ages."
Intriguing game, that can keep you occupied for many hours, days. The goals are not easy, but there are many to chose from.
Too addictive! So much to do, so little time! Start at you own peril!....
Good game!
Great game!!!
It is suitable for any age. I love it so much, I play it all the time
Enjoying it so far, plenty of objectives to keep the game interesting
Highly recommended this game to lots of friends only to have it start to produce glitches! We're all still persevering, but these need to be fixed pronto! Apart from glitches (one of which has me known only as "A Friendly Farmer" for some reason, so people can't find me!), this is the best farming game around. Lots of tasks to perform, seasonal and special quests, plus the day to day running of the farm all add up to interesting and varied gameplay. Well worth downloading and sticking with it until the glitches are sorted. Also, game support is very good.
Good app
Good but addictive
The game is definitely fun and addictive. My only gripe is the pacing. Your barn constantly fills and then the orders board will not be looking for anything you have a surplus of. It really slows the game down. The only fast solution is to make micro transactions and purchase keys. I feel like this is a deliberate machination in order to try and squeeze money from you.
Love this app. Just hard to progress easy
This game can either get me into trouble, or keep me out of it :)
Fab game, cute colourful graphics, fun quests and lots of different ways to progress. Would highly recommend!
"Great game. Very addictive. Keeps me amused for hours at a time.
Having said that, some of the tasks/quests are too hard to complete, so I give up on them.
Still a cool game tho!"
Good game but occasionally prone to freezing at important points
Used to really love this game, am addicted so still playing but it keeps crashing. I keep loosing helping hands and items I have brought. It's nice you want to improve the events but try improving the basic things first!
Love this game
This is one of the best games around. I love it, and sadly it's now part of my daily routine.... ;)
Love the game
"It's a good game, takes a long time to get into it and having to wait a long time to get the stuff.

Also I think it is a big shame it is forcing you in to get keys (pay) just to get a dog :/"
Love it very addictive
Good game and good speed
Start to play the Halloween event have managed to complete the first 3 parts of it now I'm on the part where you have to collect coco beans and CAN NOT get any of the coco beans been trying now for 2-3 days have asked team mates if they are having same problem and they have all said they can not get the coco beans no matter where we try on the farm how are we meant to complete it if we can't get the stuff to do it with please fix this or your going to lose a lot of game player
Love this game. It's taking a lot of my time but best I've played for a long time!
This game should come with a health warning - seriously addictive. And also made some good friends through the co-op page.
Alright addictive but very focused on in app purchase to help complete tasks
This game is brilliant
Like the collection of heros
Just started to play this game I think it's all right I've gotten hooked to it and I'm sure other people will love it
Awesome
Lots of fun
Free gems
Really cool
Awesome game!!

It is overall a good... But I'd rather pay for the game than pay for all stones and Items...
Great graphics, lovely music and has voice overs... Very impressive for an app game
Amazing game.
Truly an amazing ge a must play
good game
Really good game, love it.
"Very good game
Massive potential"
Simple premise with sprawling level progression. Cartoon graphics worth picking up for free
Very fun game
Keep saving gems and all I get is scrolls and talismans ...... I thought the aim was to collect warriors .....played for days with just 4 warriors .... Kind of makes the game drab
Great
Very fun
I found it to be vey good there's a lot warriors to collect recommend it to enyone

Yeah alright
I can't even play the game properly.. It keeps crashing, I'm on iPad mini 1 please fix it i really want to play
Really cool fame nice graphics
Honestly so addicted
Awesome game a must play of phone apps
Great game, smooth, fast, a balanced warrior list so that you pay WildStones for the better warriors BUT the issue with the meat almost overtakes me. Having to wait for almost an hour after having just 3 battles is really not good. Rather make the waiting time less, lower the fee of a battle or remove the concept immediately to reveal the true possibilities though. Ignoring that issue however, it is a great RPG and gives a good tutorial on the concepts of the game and how to play to full enjoyment. Well done.
Too good!
An epic game and so swiftly to play, I love it!
I love it !!
Best game ever. Literally the best game. Top of the charts

This game is really fun, has good graphics, animations are sweet but about every 5-10 minutes, the screen goes black and the game crashes. Also the game lags heaps on my iPad mini which really affects the combat, especially when I am trying to use a power and it lags and I miss the perfect are and get a weak hit.
It is a very good game. It's also really good that it is offline and online.
hopefully not everyone got same hero
Great game
It's alright.

Awesome game ever
This game's pretty fun for a free to play. It's turn based and there are some complex mechanics as well. Would recommend to those who like games such as bravely default or final fantasy.
I really enjoy how this game doesn't require internet, therefore I can you when and wherever I want :)
It's a good game with a lot of potential
A lot of fun to play!
Sweet as... Now
Amazing graphics with a great idea for a game
Love the game so much. So engaging and unique. Highly recommended!
Definitely play it :)
Really awesome so far. I really love the idea of this game but I wish your character when your fighting can block attacks, it would be pretty cool if you can but it's still good enough.
Really good I would get this game
I lost lots of time un this game. Very good app
Such a fun game
I really love this game. I love all the elements and cool characters. I also love all the moves this game is great so far I think you should put more characters in
Very impressed with this game, and I've only been playing for about an half an hour
Very good
Really well done, get it!

Great good game with good graphics
Cant wait for multiplayer
Not to far in yet but from what I have done/seen its pretty good so far. Graphics and sound are awesome. Love the battle announcer. Character progression seems interesting. Also easy to pick up some games like this tend to be to complicated at first to get interested not this.
Great game. 10/10
This game is fun, addictive and the best
Just download this game and I've been playing over an hour non stop now, the game is flu and well form but can be pretty hard to start off with though.
Its fun
"Just started and it's intriguing. Lots of tactics and scope, give it a try.

I hope it does not end up being a play to win game."
I got the game and in one day completed the first five parts!!!
Its a very cool game
I'm getting so addicted to that game
So far, pretty addictive

Awesome game so far loving it
Started playing it and I was hooked, but it crashed after finishing a battle. No big deal at first, but it kept happening, one crash after the other. Please fix, I like the game.

Amazing game, great fun graphics and animations. Combat is cool and intuitive. Highly recommend.
No issues with game. Good gameplay for this genre
This is one of the coolies game I have fever played
This game game was so funny I'm loving it
I found this app pretty well formed the only bad thing I found was that it was a little hard at the start and that can put people of if it's difficult straight away
I like the game but the game close's randomly and it gets really annoying can you fix plz
Good game love it.
"Game is very entertaining and great for all ages! 
A+++++"

Good job guys! Great game! A few minor bugs but I guess a patch is on the way?
This game brings a new vibe to app gaming
Really good
Cute, brutal, cutal
Loving it so far! Nice and refreshing play style! The animations and graphics are pretty insane too! Definitely recommend this game to people who like a good smash them up kind of game, it requires a fair bit of attention so the game becomes really engaging from the get-go!

Really great battle system
Awesome
Totally addicted :(
Really good game
Nice
I haven't even played it yet but it's awesome!!!!!!
Really good
Best game
Only been playing half an hour but very impressed.
The orders are always the same and never change, once you advance past the burger store, you need the extra boost given from upgrades which of course require gems. You get gems for ranking up or buying them, but the rate means enjoyment of the game vanishes unless you spend. I like the game but should I spend on a product that is easy once you have done and then never alters the orders?
This game was excellent but as soon as you've reached as far as the bakery you can't progress any further or get any more restaurants because the diamonds are so hard to earn. New restaurants are too expensive, diamonds are too expensive to buy with actual money and therefore I'm completely stuck. You're supposed to be able to win diamonds in the casino but now every time I spin it, no matter how many thousands of coins I waste I've never been able to win diamonds, only a few hundred coins max, and even then it's rare. There needs to be more ways to win diamonds for free or everyone will become as bored as I have.
Great game, very addictive.
This is a good game but you need way to many diamonds to reach the next level. These your have to purchase. There should be more options to move forward. You need diamonds for everything. Such a shame as once you get to one level you are stuck. Unless you want to spend real money on Diamonds. These games are a rip off. Should just pay for the app.
"Really good fun game but as other reviewers have mentioned, earning gems is way to difficult. It's so frustrating to have progressed into the game and then come up stuck because you can't earn gems quickly enough to upgrade your kitchen. It feels like a completely false, money-grabbing exercise on the part of the developer. Simply done to force you to  pay for extra gems. I would much prefer to pay extra for the game in the first place rather than come up against false obstacles. 

And that's a real shame as that's the only negative I have about the game. 

Shame."
This game is great on the first level when you can afford upgrades etc but when purchasing other restaurants the levels are far too difficult because I can't upgrade my equipment because it's impossible to get enough gems. 4000 coins and 10 gems to upgrade tea machine to serve two portion at once. Therefore cannot progress any more in this game as I am not willing to spend any money. Bored of playing same levels. Such a shame.
Love this game
Very addictive. Decent game. Only downside is it pushing you towards buying more gems etc. worth a download.
"If it wasn't for the sneaky hidden costs, this game would get 5* . It's just so frustrating to be unable to progress without spending! Far rather pay for the app up front . 
I love playing this game, but even with daily rewards, it's impossible to 3* each level without buying gems. 
Developers- if you had created each renew restaurant as an in app purchase instead, I would have bought them, but because the number if gems seems to go up exponentially with each level , I feel reluctant to purchase the gems needed to open new restaurants in case I get stung for more gems!"
Good game won't be buying any gems as they are a rip off
You have to spend tots of real money.... To rich the level you want....  So I spent money on the game maybe 1.69 but you have to spent allot more then that ,...I only completed level one And I spent so mooch ... So do't waste your mine and time.....buy buy old games ......Now the new games arrived.....where you have to spend real money......all the time......
"Good game.
Addictive"
Best game on App Store<f0><U+009F><U+0092><U+00AB>
Such a great game, for the first level. Then you need gems to upgrade practically everything, but gems are too hard to come by or too expensive. I generally don't buy in game purchases and may have to delete this game unless it becomes easier to get gems. Maybe an upfront fee with more in game gem achievements would make this game  better.
The game itself is addicting but the price of gems is ridiculous this is a game, no way am i spending over 2.99 (my limit for iap) to complete this game. Include more gems in in app purchases. Also somtimes the game doesnt react when i touch the screen this is very frustrating. Not worth buying iap rather spend my money on better games.
Gems are needed alot and there impossible to get unless you pay
I've instantly fell in love with this game I've completed 40 levels with in 2 days BUUTT... Once you get to level 40 you have to wait for an update to go on to any other levels worth downloading if you won't scream when you can't go on haha
I really like this game. Very addictive and one of the best cooking games I've played. But why is it so expensive to open the next restaurant. I would have marked this as a 5 star game. But the price let the game down.
Great game.  Addictive.  But you need gems to play and no matter how much you play you can't really earn them. Their 'free' gems that you can earn are just a rip off.   And everything just costs too many.  Too bad, honestly it's fun and could easily become a favourite.  But instead I am deleting it and finding another.
"Cooking fever is a great game witch can get quite addicting. The game makes other cooking games look like they are just the side order!<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0082> People can learn about the real world with this game and experience cooking for themselves. It may not be the same as cooking in real life, but it sure does have them pesky, impatient customers!
I would definitely recommend this app to everyone out there looking for a good game to play. <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008D><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008D><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0089><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0089>"
Well still no better with the gems since the last update although the prices have been reduced just a little... DAY LIGHT ROBBERY this game!!!! Looks as though every other review seem to have the exact agreement.... SORT IT OUT DEVELOPERS OR YOU WILL END UP LOSING A LOT OF PLAYERS........
This is a great I would suggest it to anyone who loves time management. The one problem is that you don't get enough gems compared to how much things cost. If they could lower the price or give you more that would be great.
This games is extremely addictive, however it is impossible to progress wi though spending gems! This becomes a problem when the reward for levelling up is not significant enough to unlock the required upgrades to succeed. Another way off getting gems is at the casino, but I spent 30000 coins in one go and didn't win a single gem, this game is misleading!  You have to be crazy enough to buy gems with real money or it's not worth downloading!
Great game, really fun to play
Really good fun, quite addictive!
I'm inly downloading this because of the app bounty
I love cooking fever it is such a great game I absolutely love it!
Love it
Awesome
I've never played this game and still haven't, and the reason for that is because there's this liking app for instagram, and one of the offers to earn coins was to download this game, and my credits still haven't come through! But you're still lucky I gave you guys' five <U+2B50><U+FE0F><U+2B50><U+FE0F><U+2B50><U+FE0F><U+2B50><U+FE0F><U+2B50><U+FE0F>!! Give otherwise... Imma delete this game!!!
I actually like the game, it's fun and colourful, my issue is with the pricing system of upgrades. There is no way I will pay real money to progress in a game. I would rather pay for the game and be able to upgrade, then spend money buying gems. Or even include them in the earnings. Gems should only be needed for really high cost things, not to simply upgrade a milkshake. It's also unfair you have to pay coins and gems. One or the other please. End of rant, but something needs to happen.
It is a brilliant game, very addictive, graphics are good and many fun levels with different tasks. The downside are gems though, such a rip off! I get that developers need to make money from this, but opening all the restaurants would cost approx £10 (for 160 gems needed) and that's just to open new levels, food and interior updates require way too many gems, and if I am going to buy in app purchases I would expect to get a lot more for my money. Also a bit odd that for £2.99 you get 60 gems whereas for 6.99 you get 125. Now if you buy 2 packs of 60 + a pack of 10, you end up with 130 gems for £6.67.
I love this game. It's a great way to kill time! <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0080><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0080>
Such an addictive game. Just want an update so I can play new levels!! <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0081><f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008D>
Would get 5 stars but for one thing, getting diamonds. Too expensive to buy, and very hard to get otherwise. Just a suggestion to make life easier maybe and to keep other gamers happy, when you level up, maybe you could give away a diamond or two, and to upgrade your kitchen items you also need diamonds, maybe lose the diamond upgrade so that people can get past level one.
I felt like a new gentleman when I took part in the outstanding quest to provide the customers with high ranging standards to for fill their consumable needs <f0><U+009F><U+008D><U+0094><f0><U+009F><U+008D><U+009F>
Great game so addictive but you need diamonds for everything and silly amounts for the upgrade. I've had to spend a bit of money to have more fun on the game. Otherwise don't change a thing it's great
Great game but shame about the diamond thing.  Too expensive and you can't go any further without them.
Loving this game!!!<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008D><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008D>download it ASAP. Super fun but and addictive!!!
I haven't been playing for long but I can't put it down
Love it
Like most other reviews, this game is really good and addictive but it's way too expensive to buy upgrades needed to complete the tasks and then to buy the next levels! Think developers need to rethink. I played it everyday for about a week but stopped as it got to repetitive having to repeat all the levels just to save for the next one!
"Cooking Fever is a very addictive and challenging game. However, the diamonds in the game (to buy some rare items and speed up upgrades etc.), have to be spent carefully!

As long as you keep an eye on your diamond count, you should be fine, after all, the more cunning and thoughtful you are, the better you will do!"
I really loved the game at the beginning but it soon became pay to play. Way to ruin a game. I'd rather pay a flat price then have to pay for diamonds all the time. No thank you.
It's a 10 from Len.
If you don't want to spend money delete the game as soon as you reach level 2
This game is awesome because it's stinks
I love this game I'm so addicted to it been on it for hours lol x
<f0><U+009F><U+008E><U+0089>
Kept me occupied for ages now. Really addictive, great game
Very Addictive
It is a joy to play and of cores cook! <f0><U+009F><U+008C><U+00B8><f0><U+009F><U+008C><U+00B8>
This game is ace but to fully upgrade things you need diamonds and diamonds cost money which is annoying. You can play around if though
This is a good game but sadly the developers have got greedy. To progress past the 2nd level requires more and more diamonds making this the most expensive game out there.
Great so far. Worried I'll join the pile of complaints about the diamond though.
Good game
I don't usually write reviews but it's a fantastic game great concept but the amount of diamonds you need to progress is a joke I'm stuck on level 2 because I don't have enough to unlock any upgrades or new restaurants. Not good for people who don't want to pay small fortunes for the sake of a game
I LOVE this game! So addictive and u can progress so much! A great game!!!!!!! Must get it!
so amazing! I love it so much.
Not enough diamonds to get In the game lets it down, need lots of diamonds to purchase next level and also upgrades of kitchen and tables etc... Find a way of getting free diamonds easier pls
I love this game
Good game but can be expensive if in app purchases.
I loved this game before the update and now it just freezes constantly so it's basically unplayable
Really enjoy playing this game but as you progress through the levels you can not upgrade unless you spend a fortune!!! Reduce the amount of diamonds needed to upgrade or let you earn them so how!!!
I really enjoy this game however cannot get past level 2 as I refuse to spend money on diamonds. Get in some advertisers to make your money and reduce the amount of diamonds needed to progress, or increase the amount one can win by completing tasks or via the casino etc. Having to expect friends to download the game so I can earn free diamonds to keep playing... Not going to happen. I will end up deleting as I will get bored of continuously playing the same 2 levels to earn coins to put in the casino where I never win diamonds! Fix this and it will be 5*!
Really good game but too many of the upgrades require diamonds and sometimes you win diamonds/coins but the game doesn't give them to you which is disappointing.
"The creators need to make it easier and less expensive to earn diamonds. It is not one of those games you cannot continue playing unless you pay out.

I keep failing levels because the game does not always respond when I apply the icing to the cake the first time.

Needs fixing!"
Good fun lots of challenges, well worth a look
This game is so sexy and amazin
Great fun, enjoy
This is so entertaining! I can't get enough!!
This game is  EPIC .... COOL .... I have NO words for it.
Awesome
Brill game, very addictive
I used to play cooking mama and this is like that but alot better and harder. You can't just storm through it and it's a challenge which I like. Recommended to friends and they like it too <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0084>
Very good game and very entertaining but you need gems for everything! To get an upgrade on an item, to move up levels etc. Really think the game would be a lot better if you didn't need gems for everything! Good game overall but very greedy.
I loved it ..!!
It's really good but it was a bit frustrating when I ran out of diamonds as I could not continue upgrading !Very addictive though and a good time consumer !
Love the upgrades. On level 5 at the moment and I just keep replaying levels to save up for upgrades. Definitely install to play everyone!
Great game, love playing it, but like everyone else the upgrades to the equipment once you have paid using coins is way to expensive, way to many diamonds are needed to get the full potential. I can understand using them to get new levels but to upgrade room and equipment for me is a no no, unless you reduce the amount by a lot. Would give 5stars if this happened.
I love this game. This is very nice game.
This game is one of the best cooking games I have played although they do make it extremely hard to get diamonds for free on offers and is extremely expensive just to buy a few. Also, if theyre going to make it that expensive, i believe they should lower down the price to get new places. Apart from that it is extremely good although the diamond thing does put me off which is why i play less than before when i realised how expensive the diamonds were.
Love this game very addictive. Only down fall is the money & gems.
Absolutely love this game but I wish it was easier to get gems, as I don't have the money to spend on gems I can't get any further in the game. Wish I could carry on playing but I think it's time to delete this game it's a shame. Also if the gems weren't as expensive would have been a lot better. You are greedy asking for that much money I was going to buy some gems but i looked at the pricing of them and it is waayyy to expensive am not paying that for an in game purchase sod that! You need to sort it out!! :( really frustrated as I love this game and want to play on.
I loved this game went through the first diner then on to the bakery fine earning enough diamonds to progress, but the Chinese restaurant is really hard it takes ages to move up a level and this is the only way to get diamonds to upgrade your appliances other than to buy them! I don't mind buying them odd diamond here and their but it's way too many and I'm getting bored of not being able to complete the levels within the restaurant, sort it out!! Would be a good game if you did!!
Such a good game very addictive
Love the game would have given it 5 stars but we need more ways to make diamonds or halve the amount we need and that slot machine get rid unless it only pays diamonds.
FANTASTIC GAME REALLY ADDICTIVE AND NO ADS WOHOW
Good game at first (especially the fast food restaurant) but the other levels aren't as good and are quite boring!
Love the game itself, however once to get to a certain level u can't progress without diamonds.. And they need to be purchased... I thought u might be able to get them via tapjoy but no... Disappointed....
Lots of fun!
I can't stop playing this game , it's great only downside too many gems are needed for upgrades
Thanks Stacey for getting me hooked on basically working at Burger King lol.
Too good
Really truly a great game. It's fun and addictive. Please please please. Cut the need for diamonds. That is the truly worst part of this game.
Good game, addictive, good time waster.. But once you finish one food shop and go to another you have to pay with diamonds which means spending money which I don't want to do...shame.
Worth downloading for the first level which is great, but after that you need to purchase gems to unlock levels and to upgrade equipment. Disappointing.
Very good addictive app and pretty smooth but as soon as u unlock the casino and it tells u to go into it u cant click on it to proceed so ur game gets screwed up because u cant do anything. Fix this and it gets a 5/5
Pretty addictive and fun to play! :)
Good game! Can't put down my iPhone!
Great game, very enjoyable. But in order to progress you need to purchase gems...and then more gems...and then even more! Very greedy. Normally this could be ignored, but you are unable to progress through levels without spending a small fortune. 10 gems to upgrade an item to level 2 is ridiculous. Pure greed.
Instagram: guess_what_somebody_actually_
I was addicted to this game up until level 3, now it's virtually impossible to continue without upgrading and to do that, I need diamonds. I've stopped playing this game now. As will everyone else that doesn't wish to pay for extra diamonds.
Really enjoyed the game at first couldn't come off it but then got too hard because couldn't upgrade with no diamonds. Deleted.
Diamonds too expensive and can't see a way to earn them. Shame as a good game but soon I won't be able to play as don't have any diamonds left!
Highly addictive!! Great though
A good game that keeps you hooked. It's challenging but not too difficult that you give up or too easy that you get bored.
I can't believe this game is free! I am so addicted and play it with ma baes in Wales!
I love this game! Some games I play for bit then get bored but this game I CANT PUT DOWN! Highly recommend for any age! It's defo worth a download! Xx<f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008C><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0083>
Amazing and lots of levels to play even better than cooking dash !!! And the even better is, it is free!
Very addictive. However the touch is so slow to respond and when you put the plate over a person a lot of the time it doesn't do anything. It makes it even more frustrating.
I love this game so much and play it constantly, but my breakfast place still isn't working, I saved up all my gems and money to unlock it and it wouldn't open, just stayed on the loading page, then I noticed it said to update it to fix bugs on the breakfast shop so I updated the game and it's still not opening the breakfast place? Please can someone fix this?!
Love the concept for the whole game. Addictive and very good at passing time whilst keeping you entertained!
Really fun game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Brill game!!
I don't often write reviews on games but i got to say this is one of the best games i've ever downloaded. I saw it on and ad and decided to try it. The minute, i couldn't stop playing. Truly amazing! I like the fact that you can replay levels to earn more money so you can upgrade. I definitely recommend this game. Also it's FREE so what more could you want? :)
All game is AMAZING, but... mostly everything is based on gems which is difficult or I could say impossible to get. I would like to see easier way to get gems which could make all players happier. Thank you.
Just downloaded and seems to be great fun. Not paid any money so far which is even better. Look forward to playing some more. Only four stars as I have played enough levels but once I get a bit further I'll re-review.
Great game the title I have put describes how this game over all great game deserves to be on the top of the leaderboard not wherever it is so go on push install
Love this game, so fun to play in my spare time and really addictive! 5/5 I'd say!!!!
I'm super addicted to this game, it gets harder and harder the more you get into it and it's strangely satisfying to play!
Love the game but I can't upgrade anything even tho I have plenty of money for the stuff
Fun game
This game is so much fun to play and I completed the first restaurant without making any purchases but now I can't progress without spending money which is fair enough but it won't let me access my iTunes to make a purchase. At first I thought it might not be games fault but it works on all my other apps so this must be a flaw within the game. Hopefully they will resolve this in an update. Other than those issues love it!
Brilliant game.. Totally addictive
So fun and full of stuff to do, just wish in game purchases were a little cheaper!
This app is great and now with the new update it's even better this app is for all ages it's great it will get pretty hard also there is a lot of levels I recommend this app to anyone!<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008B>
Great game, very addictive. Not sure what age it would be fitting best but higher levels are quite hard. The downside is diamonds - too many upgrades require diamonds, opening new restaurants require way too many diamonds and once you pay that you basically cannot upgrade anything in the kitchen because this requires diamonds too. Either need more diamonds awarded per level or just cut out diamonds from upgrades, comes too expensive. If developers interested in making this game popular - really need to cut down this diamond craze, it won't be popular this way..
love the game soo addictive
Highly addictive game! Most fun I've had from a app in a long while
"Considering deleting app cost way to much 
Ridiculous !!
If that changes would love this game"
Amazing game would download! So addictive
"Gameplay, graphics and concept all great. 

Let down by unbalanced reward system - you only have to complete a couple of levels before it's painfully obvious that you cannot progress without 'gem' upgrades, which are in very short supply. 

Therefore - either start shelling out for gems (spending up to £69.99) or accept that it's another good idea let down by greedy gameplay design."
"Love this game but it's the standard 'pull you in and then expect you to spend a ridiculous amount of money to continue'.
Diamonds - too expensive/overused. I get that they need to make money somehow but this is too much and no one will want to pay. Or play."
I have installed a lot of cooking games like this one and I must say this is definitely one of the better ones. Hooked already!
Really fun game to play.
Love it. So addictive. But need some way to gain free gems.
I'm enjoying it
Very addictive easy to play fun only problem like everyone else says is gems it's annoying having to have them to get your up grades !!!!!
Enjoyable
Saw this on an add and thought I'd give it a go. Best one I've played yet! Challenging to say the least, which most of these aren't. My only problem is I keep picking up the wrong stuff :P
Soooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooaddictive
Love the game very catching !
"The gameplay is actually really good, all the addictive and fun quality that comes with a well designed game.
But the excessive need for gems to progress lets it down. Just add another way to get gems eg. Coin conversion or lower the amount of gems needed to upgrade. Needing this many gems brings gameplay to a grinding halt and ruins our enjoyment.."
So addictive
Really good. Really addictive. Should be able to gain more gems easier but it's normal for these types of game. Have managed to lose 2 days to this game so be aware it can be very addictive!
Very good game. Nice little time waster.
Brilliant game ... Absolutely love it
Lots of fun and good for winding down
Best game ever
Love this but I really need to get quicker. Keep burning everything
Just can't stop playing this game once you start. Takes skill to manage your time and cooking too many things but I seem to have got the hang of it. Great game.
Game is great but u have to save ur gems hard to be able to move any where and they cost a fortune
I really like this game but it can get quite frustrating as it is harder to get to the next level and it takes up quite a lot of your money on the game to get to the next shop
Addictive and perhaps my favourite iOS game ever!
Had ipad for 2 yrs now this is the most addictive game ever so say goodbye to your work lol
"I'm so glad I found this game. It's addictive but fun. It also needs your complete attention and gives your brain (and fingers) a good workout. 

A must have game!"
Great game but the controls  because of the small screen can make you mess up quite a bit otherwise great game.
I was going to write a review about the gems but apparently as per all reviews below everyone feels the same. Hopefully this will be fixed soon otherwise the app is getting deleted. Becomes boring having to replay the same levels over and over just so can level up and get a very poor amount of gems!!
Good funny
Good game
Really good!
It's a great game:) really addictive
Addictive!!!
"Really smooth gameplay.
Great game i must say A*****"
"Awesome game! In addicted to it however like other users, it's very hard to proceed since the gems are very hard to earn without using real money. 

I think it's best if the upgrades are in coins but at an expensive value rather than with gems that are almost impossible to get."
"Great way to be a chef and try cooking at it's best so
Far liking it 
Getting the hang off it now thanks"
Great game very addictive
You get to make real food this game is awesome play it it is cool 5 (rate)
This such a good game! I'm so surprised this is a free app! Normally you would have to pay for something like this but no! It's free and so addictive! <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00B1><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00B1><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00B1>
This game reminds me of the games I used to play on my computer when I was like 10. Its simple but addictive and very amusing!
Very addictive can't put it down
When I first played this game I thought it was brilliant! BUT then I realised I couldn't progress without buying gems which cost real money. You get to a certain point where you can't progress further in the game without buying gems and that is a real shame as it's the only thing spoiling the game!
This app is amazing it is extremely addictive but stupidly fun because YOU HAVE YOURE OWN CAFE ,BAKERY ect. This app is just the best !!!
Nice
Great game...to make money for the developers! Love the game but how to upgrade anything without gems??? Simple answer....you can't. So you have to purchase gems.....making money for the developer. Such a shame!! Not impressed because of that. There are loads of games like this on the market, so it's about being competitive....this aspect just makes me want to remove it from my iPad!
I love the concept of the game and it is very well made but the fact I need to buy gems to continue is very frustrating. I can understand using gems to buy the next restaurant as you can earn them through the previous level, but having to use gems to buy upgrades of equipment, which you need in order to complete the level fast enough, is very irritating. I can see that once I reach a certain level I will have to stop purely because it refuse to spend real money in an app game! What about being able to convert the money you have earned into gems?
I love this game it is amazing I thought it would be like others buts it's not. However, I'm really bugged at how many gems you're suppose to use to upgrade items and buy new shops <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+009F>
It's a really fun and enjoyable app were you don't need to pay money to play the game at a nice pace. Only problem I have is its a struggle to play on iphone ect anything with a small screen. Sometimes I miss things even tho I think I have it and causes a chain reaction of failure. But that's just me.
Have to buy gems ;-(
I really o like this game and it is addictive but I dose get harder as you go to the next levels and I so tell other people about this game I hope everyone else enjoys this game!(sorry for punctuation)
This is a fun and addictive app, hard to put down once you start playing. One thing I don't like is the way they've designed dragging items, it's very easy to drop lettuce/ketchup etc in the wrong place since it's not matched up with where you place your finger, instead it's just above with the image of the item.
Having hours of fun with this game, 'does what it says on the tin!'
BUY THIS NOW!!!!!!! This game is so addictive and so fun and u get to unlock things and have limited offers on things. Who would actually hate this game. If you do hate it, you are missing out so badly.
Best Game ever played even thou there r some in app purchases u can still get the money n gems within no time really good! <f0><U+009F><U+008D><U+0095><f0><U+009F><U+008D><U+0094><f0><U+009F><U+008D><U+009F><f0><U+009F><U+008D><U+0097><f0><U+009F><U+008D><U+0096>
most addictive game<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0082>defo worth the phone battery
Very addictive fun game, fun graphics too
Great game 5 star.  Needed to do it for a google phones
Really good and enjoyable game. Shame you can't progress very far before you have to purchase gems ! Makes it disappointing
"Great game and very fun to play but two main issues I've had:

A) on an iPhone 5, the screen is quite packed...because of the drag and drop system, it's easy to pick up the wrong thing because you didn't click exactly in the middle of the item you want. I've made so many of the wrong thing because my thumbs inadvertently pressing the wrong option.

B) As everyone else has said, the gems are ridiculous. I'm all for micro transactions but they shouldn't be compulsory to play as it is with this one. 10 gems to buy an upgrade you need to have is pathetic."
This game is really fun and addictive. It gets really challenging but you can collect coins to buy upgrades to make it a little easier. I recommend that you download this because it's free and really good!
I'm enjoying the game, abit addictive, the only thing id say is about the cost of gems, needs to be a easier way to earn gems because you need them to  upgrade your machines. Other than that I'm enjoying it :) x
I like this game and it seems very big.
Love this game, its so much fun i would recommend it to anyone!
This is excellent game if I were u I would get it , but if u don't think your a very good game player then on level 20 and up it gets really quick and I had to spend my gems on getting a quick cooking machine. That is the only reason I managed to get this far (in my opinion) it would be nice if there was a easy-medium-hard icon that would be greatly appreciated
I absolutely love this game I can't stop playing it but gems are so hard to earn and it's taking me forever to upgrade things and buy new restaurants and I don't want to spend my real money on the game!
I really enjoy these types of games and luckily it's not the type where you play a few levels and have to buy the full game (which I hate!) this game I thought would be great to play to past time but I'm finding myself playing this for ages at a time by accident <f0><U+009F><U+0099><U+0088> I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys these time management games just as much as I do! <U+263A><U+FE0F>
Only just started to play it but I love it
Excellent although I'm not very good
"I really like the game. 
Very addictive but I don't like the way you can't earn many gems.
And you have to have them to progress, so it means anyone who doesn't have the money, isn't allowed or simply doesn't agree with spending physical cash for digital good are penalised.

Plants vs zombies started out this way too but I hope that like them this app can get creative and solve that problem. Make it more inclusive for all."
"Really enjoyable game, easier to pick up and hard to put down. Runs very smoothly and hasn't crashed even once. 
However, items that cost gems in this game are quite expensive so you may find it hard to purchase certain items and other restaurants as they cost gems. And a lot of them. The level cap also makes it difficult to collect gems and once you reach level 30, the gem income grinds to a halt and motivation to play the game dwindles. Furthermore, the option to purchase coins seems a rather pointless as you could easily earn them by just replaying levels. 
So I personally think that if certain items cost maybe 1 or 2 less gems, it'd would be perfect. 
But I have really enjoyed this app and think that despite its flaws, it's a brilliant game and would recommend it to friends."
Loving this game but I think you should be able to swap coins for gems. It would make it more personalised as to how you update and improve the game! I has to reset cause I got stuck without enough gems to continue.
Good game but doesn't let you get far without spending money!
Great
So addictive!
Not too difficult yet addictive and enjoyable
Fabulous game a lot of fun I love that you have to upgrade all of the things and it goes faster and you can lose your costumers it an amazing game I would recommend it I love it is addictive just like minion rush
Love this game
Words can't describe how good this game is. It's amazing <f0><U+009F><U+0099><U+0089>
Loving this game! Download it now, I can't stop playing it. It's very addictive.
This game is incredibly addictive but the gems make it really hard and sometimes expensive to progress in the game it just ruins it.
"Really good game!!! Thanks to the developers!
<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0084><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0084><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0084><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0084><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0084><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0084>"
Addicting game to keep you going for hours to come! There's no reason not to get it!
"So I downloaded this game because of the reviews and it looked interesting. After finishing my first cafe, I bought another one (coins and gems needed). After playing the first level, it was going great UNTIL I found the upgrades need gems to purchase? Levelling up is a pain so your only option is to purchase the gems, at a stupid price.

I'm sorry but this game would be 10/5 star review but not now! I know game developers need to make money but remove the God damn gems! Or at least, remove the gems for upgrades!"
Ten out of ten
<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0084>good
I've played a lot of these type of games but this has to be the best one!  it doesn't force you to buy in app purchases as much as other games. Graphics pretty good and it is a good time passer, I do recommend this :)
It's so fun and really enjoyable to play!!!!!!<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0084><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0083><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0084>
Great fun. Not had problem with gems needed to progress but watch this space!
Such a good game and very addicting, I love it but where it says get free diamonds you can only do 4 things, can you make it where watch a video and get 1 free diamond please, thanks.
Good fun. Likes to spend diamonds without realising at times!
"By far the best app on my phone! 
The only thing I'd say is making the gem regen a bit quicker but apart from that great game!"
"This is awesome I got many ads promoting the game and I thought it looked really fun and now I got it and found out what I thought was the truth! It has fair rewards and diamonds/gems when you level up by experience I play this all the time now!!!!!!

XShmurrx"
This game is so good I can't get of, off it thank you for making this games so good and amazing <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0083><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0083><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0083><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0083><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0083><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+009D><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0083><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0083><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0083><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0083><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0083><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+009D><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0083><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0083><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0083><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+009D><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0083><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+009D><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0083><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+009D><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0083><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0083><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0083>
It ok I suppose
Really gets you motivated, great for memory and concentration while having a creative element alongside it also.
Yet another highly addictive game but with this one u can keep playing over & over which is a bonus but the only trouble is u can upgrade u kitchen with coins but the further in you get u need gems 2 so the same as usual, but still enjoyable :)
This game's straight gangsta yo! Flipping burgers at Burger King ain't nothing compared to this game. yo, this game made me a flipping pro!
Love this game but very addictive
This game is fun and very addictive. I personally love this game because you are in charge of everything!
Great game, really addictive. Only being ruined by the need for gems. They want you to spend real money on them which is making me quit! <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0094>
There is only one word to describe this game and that is AMAZING!!!!!!!!!!
"This game is addictive like no other. I can't stop playing it, because every time I see it on my homepage I can't help myself but play it. I cannot believe it is free, it is a must have. There are so much levels it's very hard to finish, so you look forward to something new every time you go on it.
Top class app!"
Plzzzzzz down load btw it's really fun
If you had a link button to contact you I would have said the same as another reviewer. I have earned the coins but when I press upgrade it says.. Not enough coins? I would have marked this game as 5 star but if it's not updated to fix the bug I'm deleting it otherwise what's the point in playing.  The first restaurant was bug free the bakery is not letting me upgrade to three star ??
Great game whole family addicted to it, o love you issue is the gems to get any further now I need loads of gems an they r not easily obtainable unless u spend loads of money. Would love to see an update containing easier access to gems even the casino have spent like 30000 an have never won any getting frustrated, other than that gr8 game
Amazing
I hate the customers they throw a tantrum when you don't give the food or drink
The only great game I've played where you don't have to wait for 'lives' to play! So fun
Really good game
Love this game !!!
Fantastic gameplay loads of levels loads of extras too.
Good game but very addictive
Amazing game, just wish that you unlocked each restaurant as you progressed instead of having to buy them :c
This game is great, challenging and fun...BUT it's very hard to progress further as the game needs you to purchase gems to do so. Would be much better if like other games it allowed you to earn them over time, rather than just give you a couple once you've completed a few levels. I've completed all levels and don't have enough gems to buy anything else so cannot play anymore without spending real money!
such an addictive game <U+2728>
This game is really addictive.  Love it!
I don't know if I am the only one who has experienced this but when picking up and dropping food into the buns you have to be extremely precise. This became too annoying and in result I have deleted the game, which is a shame because the idea of it is entertaining.
I think this is a good game but the customers are too impatient !!
BEAST INSTALL IT NOW!
AmAzing game love it
Amazing !!<U+2764><U+FE0F><f0><U+009F><U+0092><U+009C><U+2764><U+FE0F> addicted !!
It's hard as it goes quick but when you upgrade you can do anything same it's only 30 levels
When you get on level 3 it starts getting challenging because it's fast apart from that it's really fun for kids :))
Absolutely loving the game. I'm a new player however I've already been on it for ages and don't want to stop. It's a very good game. Something everybody could enjoy. Great fun!
Great game for being free. Addictive and makes your mind work quickly!
It is so awesome everyone should love it and play it all the time
Why not give it a try? What's the worst that could happen? Really fun and the best part about this game is although there is the option for IAP - it really isn't a requirement, you can earn 'diamonds' by levelling up, gambling for them in the casino and earning achievements. Give it a shot! :)
Brilliant little game especially as it's free ! Very addictive tho!
Cute game.
This is a very addictive game.......right up to the point where you cannot progress any further without having to buy gems off of real money. As usual, a decent game ruined by greed.
Fantastic and funny game
Brilliant game. I have unlocked 35 levels in a matter of hours. That is how addictive it is. Enjoy
What a game amazing
Wymiata
"Coolest game ever 
I have played many cooking games and COOKING FEVER tops them all!!!!!!!!!       Should seriously get this game u don't know what ur missing!!!!!"
Luv this game makes me hungry For more
Gets annoying when the game keeps dimming through the game
Started off as quite good then it gets repetitive in that to advance you either have to pay out with real money and a lot of it or keep playing the same levels to get anywhere. Bit frustrating that you can only really advance by buying upgrades but after the first set you have to use diamonds but seeing as they don't come as freely as the money it really slows u down as the further u get the more you need the upgrades. Save your time and money
I'm loving this game, completely addictive, the goals are achievable and it passes the time.
Fun, fast and addictive
Love this game very addictive alot like kitchen brigade computer game always wanted a game like this on ipad thanks
I think this is a very good game to play for any ages I just love it !!!

Amazing game I'm loving it..!!<f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008D>
Amazing App I really love it
Really addictive
Best cooking app I give 5 stars
This is like the most fun & addictive game ever , keep the updates coming <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008A>
"I personally think that it is a great game for kids!
It's really easy!"
Good game! Recommend!
But now you have to buy gems to get far. Won't spend money on it, shame as it is such a good game.
Would be good to be able to earn more diamonds to progress though.
The game is challenging and fun. I look forward to see it develop further.
Great game, really gets you on the edge of your seat. I would say my multitasking abilities have improved since I played this
Good game <f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008D>
Fantastic
Lots of fun.
Every time I use the casino it never gives a win I've been on this game since two months and I play it every day including the casino and I haven't once won you need to make this more fair
"I do this this game is alright

I originally downloaded this game through a third party app, and was going to delete it after I had finished the tutorial. However, I found the game so fun it's still here! As another review stated, I've yet to find an in app purchase, which I find makes the game fairer and more enjoyable to play. A great addictive game and fun all round. Five stars <f0><U+009F><U+008C><U+009F>
Great game, well made, very addictive! Thank you!
"Half way throughout playing the game, I lost the option to upgrade my items. Can anyone help me?

Nonetheless, a fantastic game! Well worth it and fun to play."
very addictive and fun you can upgrade to make more food cant keep off it
Great time menagment game
It's so fun
"As a Time Management game junkie, this ticked all my boxes. I can lose hours quite happily playing this :)
More like this please."
Be warned, highly addictive game. I put my two kids in charge of their own section, you should see the fireworks!
Very addictive game. Brill ain't fun :)

Very addictive - love it!
Makes you think good game
You must buy this app right away because it's amazing cannot stop playing it, every time to cook you earn money to spend on your shop for free! You must get it now because you are missing out so what are you waiting for. It's different to all of the other games also it has over 300 levels which get harder so you want to carry on playing. Must download you are missing out!
Very addictive
Very addictive game
Really nice little time management game :)
Great fun game
I love the game, it's an amazing time management and the graphics are great but for some reason with over 3000 coins it won't let me use them and is trying to force me to use gems.  It's really detracting from the fun because it's hard to complete levels when I can't upgrade. Please fix this because this isn't fun anymore.
Thus game is fun
Love this game!
More levels please love it
Fun and addictive!
WHY have I got to buy gems to get into other levels?! 30/40 gems at a time, and they aren't cheap! Loved playing this game but I'm deleting it as I begrudge paying to gain more levels.
I didn't rate it when I first got it cause I was so into it. I'm rating this now because I think that the developers need to know that they have done an excellent job!
If you like time management games this is the one for you. I've not been playing it long but so far I've not come across any in app purchases for a change you only buy them with the credits earned in each round. Really liking it so far!
Very addictive and lots of fun
Nice design too
This app/game is really fine. Everyone who reads this review needs to get it. It's well good! Try it!
Great game. Can't stop playing it!
Love the game!!!! Loads of levels !!! Best cooking game in the App Store !!!
Why does it take me back to the main menu every time I play a level? Still far too hard to collect diamonds.
It's the 2nd best game I've ever played! My 1st is 101 games which is the same company! My cousin has it too and I had a go and now I absolutely love it!! Actually it's my 1st best game!! Cos the 101 games are kinda hard but I still love the app! <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0084>
Great game though I've just started can't put it down?
No annoying in app buying. Best game like this on iTunes
The real bias of any of these games is that they ask for ratings before you have the chance to judge fairly....at the beginning  I gave 5... I now give 2 stars....could be a brilliant game without that greedy desire to make quick money out of us As has been said...they try and hook you in...then you realise it really is only your money they are after...not about you enjoying a game. Such a shame they think in app purchases is ok...it is ridiculous and a one off payment should be considered...you greedy twerps.
Great game lots to do easy to play , but please not so many crystal to progress
I'm really enjoying this game. Can't put it down. Very good for working on reactions.
Like many of the other reviewers I loved this game initially. But then realised you need diamonds to do practically anything and you can only earn 2 a day as long as you log in every day after your first 7 days of logging in. But most of the upgrades need at least 5-10 diamonds. Making the game difficult to pay, the makers just want your money. ! I've stopped playing now after realising I can't really progress without the diamonds despite the fact I have 100's of thousands in the game bank. Just no where near enough diamonds to buy new restaurant or more room upgrades, therefore making earning 3 stars on each level virtually impossible!
Good
Brilliant never cooked as fast in my life fantastic only on game 10 can't wait for the rest lol
You should be ashamed of yourselves, I spent hundreds on Nord and now you have turned greedy? Get to a certain point and then can't progress due to lack of gems so only option is to buy
Incredibly irritating, it's a complete con. You get really into it on the first 2 round which take no more than an evening, but then the only way to progress is with crystals which are easy to get at first but then near impossible by level 3 it would take you weeks of failing at the same levels to get the. To then no doubt on that level fail due to being unable to purchase the equipment necessary. Very greedy game owners, it's a shame because if they did it so you did a few more levels first you may be more untied to buy the crystals but no one is that stupid as by the end of level 2 the only way to pass the rounds is buy purchasing stuff so even if you got to level 3 you could keep going due to the necessary purchases
I enjoyed it a lot!!!thanks
I have only reached level 15 in first burger bar but it is ok so far.
It's a great game and I love playing it, but my daughter and nieces and. Nephews try and play it but the rate that the customers appear frustrate them as they come about too fast so maybe you could slow them down???
Good fun if u like cooking games this is one to play
So addicated.
"I started out loving this game. Fun easy to play and really addictive. But this all changes by the time you get to the Asian level. You need to buy upgrades almost strait away to have any chance of getting trough levels as things just don't cook quick enough. And as gems don't come as easy as they seemed to at the start the only option is to buy gems which are ridiculously expensive. 
So nearly a great game but ruined in my opinion by greed"
Good game,the only thing that need fixing is when it sometimes freezes,which is abit annoying,but its a good game<f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008D>
This is a good game, keeps me entertained.
Great game only thing I have with the game the food burns so fast
Was really enjoying the game until I got to the Asian restaurant (3rd one) and then the game is ruined by the developers once again as you cannot progress without having to buy gems to upgrade the kitchen equipment. Therefore you lose custom and cannot complete many further levels! Big shame!
It's quite fun. Love it:)
Just can't stop playing it!
Enjoy playing this, lots of levels.
"A fun, well written title, but by the time you get to the Asian restaurant, you realise that its no better than any of the other In App Purchase based disappointments, and just wants to take your money over and over and over again.

Uninstalled."
Good
Best best best game I have EVER played! It's great for when you are bored. Love love love it! I recommend it to ANYONE who loves there's sort of games! <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0084><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0084><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0084>
First game I havnt found myself getting bored
This game is very addictive once you start you can't stop and the graphics are excellent
Really liking it, graphics are good and the levels are becoming more and more challenging.
Something to do when bored
I love this game
This fame offers the virtual experience of fast food and a high graphics engine! I'm impressed completely and hope to find multiple amazing updates in the future
Constantly interrupts game for reviews this is ridiculous
Puikus zaidimas saunuoliai !!!!!!
Really good game keeps you on your toes
"I'm enjoying this a lot, it is exactly what I want from this sort of game. 

The only reason it isn't 5* is that there is a slight bug where the woman keeps telling me that things are burnt and that I must throw them away - even though nothing is burnt which means that I can't get rid of the message and it blocks out parts of the game which can be frustrating"
Love these games keep making more
Addicted. Lithuanian knows how to create games.
Great game very addictive easy to earn gems so you can upgrade your food gets harder higher up in the levels definitely recommend
No life refill very addictive LOVE IT
No waiting for lives to be able to play on
Cant do anything without gems rip off!!!!
It's a fun and addictive game, but unless you save all the gems you will get stuck. Had to re start from the beginning so I can open other restaurants or add upgrades that make a difference. The only other way to get gems is to buy which is ridiculous.
<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008D>
Only it's more detailed as far as the food prep and you don't have to seat people
I love this game so much fun!!!
"I LOVED this game when I first got it, and worked feverishly to earn upgrades and 3-star every level. Unfortunately, once you level up enough times, the rewards dry up fast while the upgrades keep getting more expensive. There is absolutely no way to keep progressing at this point without spending A LOT of real money (except maybe grinding the same level literally 50 times so you can get one more equipment upgrade, then repeat). I shelled out $3 at one point because I thought that would take me much further in terms if upgrades, but it didn't at all. I don't ever play this anymore.

*also, as others have noted, it is basically impossible to play with your fingers, I always used a stylus."
I just got it yesterday and I started to play today! So addicting!!!
I haven't stopped playing since I started! <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0084>
Just don't like the siding part. <U+2764><U+FE0F>
The game is great but the clickable area is just too small around objects so on an iphone 5s you can barely hit the targets. Maybe i just have fat fingers
I think it's a great game. It's fun and easy to use. It's better than some games out there. But I think there should be a easier way to earn gems.
Way coo tightened upped our cook skills way fun focus,,,
It was a real fun and addicting game
I love this game!  Just wish I could get more diamonds.
Haven't played long
I love this game is so addicting
As for the ones who say it is a rip off,you just have to learn the aspects of the game. Addictive and fun to play.
The first level is designed to get you hooked.   The more you play the more impossible it is to continue without shelling out BIG bucks.  Gems are expensive.  5 dollars for enough gems to upgrade your dishes enough to win 2 levels than you need 5 bucks again.  The upgrades require so many gems that you need to buy them to keep going.  To win this whole game you will need like 60 dollars.  Maybe this app is worth that to you. I would rather buy a real video game for that kind of money. Also the later levels are designed to be impossible to beat without buying upgrades.
This is a great game if you aren't willing to pay extra for coins and gems then you will hate this game. I didn't even have to pay one penny yet to reach level 20. I love this game!
Very addictive and would be a great game if it were not for the GEMS.  It's ridiculous to HAVE to purchase gems in order to advance.  Don't waste ur time and especially ur money on a game that's supposed to be FREE.
I've loved playing and beat all the levels so far.  I agree with other reviewers though.  You don't earn enough diamonds.  It forces you to spend too much money if you want to keep playing!
Every time I make the pie exactly like it is it will not take it and I can't get pass it.. Thanks in advance!
I like it. If you actually put some effort into it you don't have to put any extra money into it.
...
Great game except you run out of gems
Kinda fun
It was a fun game at first, but then it kept lagging, to the point where things responded a second later than I pressed. Then there was crashing too, so I just gave up playing. Reading others' reviews about the rip off gems and leveling up, I have no guilt in deleting this app.
Great game
Nice game
Love this game
I really like this game kills time it's really enjoyable couldn't ask for better!<f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008D>
This game is actually really fun I really enjoy playing it :)
alottttt
I don't mind the occasional purchase but this game requires a huge investment in gems to keep playing. It is too bad as the gameplay is fun and time management games are my favorite. A real shame.
It wasn't letting me take things off and on the grill,and the cola machine. It wasn't letting me give costomers the food and drinks they wanted
When I first began playing I was hooked, the game was fun and moved along quickly, once I got to the bakery it seemed like the only way to move forward was with gems, which are difficult to acquire. It becomes hugely discouraging to play a game when the only point is for the creators to earn money via gem price gouging. Such a big let down. Everything else was awesome.
Wife can't put it down!
I enjoyed the game until they changed it that you no longer receive daily diamonds. Now you only get 2 once a week instead of daily. Since the only other way to get diamonds is to buy them and everything requires significant diamonds it is a fortune to play a mediocre game. No thank you. When they become less greedy I'll consider downloading the app again. But for now they can bite me.
I like this game.
I have played a TON of time management and cooking games in my life, and I actually really enjoy this one!  I have had no trouble earning three stars on each level, earning gems is a bit tough but you don't want everything just handed to you, whats the point of playing it if there is no skill involved? So i'm quite pleased with this game! Great job!
This is an awesome game and I live that it was free.
I uploaded this game a while back and was addicted from the beginning. I had opened 4 restaurants within a couple days. I currently have the first 2 completed with 3 stars on every level and almost finished with the 3rd. But I have the same complaint as everyone else. GEMS. I'm currently sitting at 66 gems. I play the casino daily and that's how I've earned so many. It take a lot of coins to earn gems in the casino but I can deal with that given I can go from 1000 coins to 10,000 coins in a couple hours if I tried hard enough. My problem is the earning of gems in the casino. It seems to me that it only lands on gems once a day and it's always the same ones. Even with coins. I've hit 3 single and 3 double coins for a reward of 600 and 1000 coins and 3 single gems for a reward of 15 gems. I have yet to hit 3 triples for coins or 3 doubles or triples for gems and beginning to think it's not possible. It should be a lot easier to earn coins, especially in the casino. I have yet to spend any real money to play this game and even if I had all the money in the world, I still wouldn't. Make it easier to earn gems and I'll bump my rating up to 5 stars.
"This game was fun until you run out of gems. You cannot advance to the next level unless you upgrade your foods and appliances. Even decorating your restaurant costs a lot of gems. This company is very GREEDY to put this kind of price on their games. Be careful because greed will lead you to your downfall. 
Great game to play but very disappointed in the company. Shame on you!"
Love this game. It is challenging, but very good.
I love this game it helps multi task better And pay attention.
I got addicted in the first day I couldn't sleep omg <f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+0091><f0><U+009F><U+0092><U+0098><f0><U+009F><U+0097><U+00BF> perfect for actually anybody !
Only on lvl 5, but fun so far.
Great fun, except there are only a few ways to get gems...there need to be other ways! Tap joy, anyone?
At later levels, you have to use a lot of gems to pass the level. There is no easy way to get those gems if you do not buy them. The casino totally doesn't make sense.
This is swag
Cute game, pretty similar to others I've played but fun enough to keep me coming back.  Why 3 stars?  If you're wanting a free game-look somewhere else!  It's free up until you want to max out your upgrades in restaurant one.  You earn coins through the game that you use to upgrade until you want to max them.  Then it costs gems.  I've gotten top marks on every level up to level 35 and have only accrued 3 gems through leveling my experience up.  I'm at experience level 9.  To upgrade ONE THING I need five gems.  The only way to get them?  Purchase. It only gets worse the further you get in the game.  If the game is marketed as 'free' then there should be a way to continue on by earning gems.  Make it challenging or whatever but make it an option!  The sad thing is that I would purchase this game for a few bucks in a heartbeat if there was another way to move forward but I will not pay to advance levels.  Their loss, I guess.
This is my absolute favorite game on my phone!! Had to delete it because I got to the point where gems were impossible to get and you needed gems for everything. You should take the gems out of the game all together and make it with only the coins but dont over price everything! Please fix!! I really love this game!!!
Just as the people say. You need more ways to earn gems. Maybe in the achievements part instead of just money gems here and there would be nice. It is impossible to continue on in the game without buying gems with your own money.
Fun for those who love preparing food
My biggest problem with the game is that when the level is almost complete, the screen gets really dark and it's hard to see what's going on. I guess it's trying to simulate the closing of the store but it is unnecessary and a little irritating.
I love all levels of cooking and good environment.
I really like this game especially its option to reset your progress
I recently purchased 60 gems for my daughter and they're not available. About to delete the app.
Add an ice cream parlor  place and this game would be even better!!!!!
Having a lot of fun. Great game
I haven't been bothered with watching videos to earn more or having to pre purchase anything to carry on with the game!  So far all is spot on!
I love this game
Reminds me of childhood playing crazytown
This game is truly addicting but... It needs to have more ways to earn gems and less expensive upgrades.
"This game is aight I guess, they should use more food items to make the game more realistic but other than that it's good. 
:)"
Great app to ever have you should have it for real tho
It's really fun I like it
I haven never written a review before but I am at my wits end. I was in LOVE with this game and couldn't put it down, however I find myself now at a standstill. I haven't played in weeks because it is no longer fun if I can't upgrade any of my supplies due to a lack of gems. I download the games that will get me free coins, I would be willing to do the same for gems. Please fix this so I can enjoy my favorite game again. If this gets fixed I will immediately give a 5/5!! Thank you!!
Point stated. Unless you like spending 100$ on imaginary things
Loving the game
Good way to pass time
I went searching for a cooking game and I found this one and I was pleased. Then I saw how much it cost to unlock levels and I was disappointed. Then I was even more upset that my progress isn't the same on each of my apple devices. Not even through Game Center. I would've given this game 5 stars but those two things each cost a star.
It's very good game!
Free means not spending money
My phone was stolen and I loved this game so much I downloaded it on my boyfriend's phone I love to restart this game and play over n over pretty lame but it keeps me occupied lol
This is the best cooking game I've played! It actually feels like your doing something rather than waiting in "real-time" for your food to get done like in all the other games. I give it an A+!
Easy to play
Great Game!
Extremely frustrating and obnoxious that you can only advance through the game by spending hundreds of dollars in gems. Ridiculous.
This game is very challenging that's why I give it 5stars it keeps me on my toes....:)
It was a little unappealing but... Eh
After purchasing the indian restaurant, I have not been able to play because it won't load. Please fix this. Thank you!
Fun
Divertido
I wish you didn't need gems to upgrade things
I am only giving this 4 stars because the levels get really hard and it's really hard to get 3 stars on them. Other then that it is very addicting and fun. I do think the casino is a rip off. I hardly ever get anything. I did have a lot of coins and I kept playing until I got gems so I was able to unlock the next restaurant :) I refuse to pay for gems so I'll keep using the casino.
Good game! I enjoy it very much.
It's so much fun & it's addicting!!!! Good game!
It's good bruh
Love it's amazing
Love this game. Lots of fun
VERY FUN
Fun
Fun and easy.
"For a free game, it's pretty fun (4.5 stars).  It offers a lot of free stuff to play without having to buy, it just takes longer (actually the fun part).

ANNOYANCE:  drag and drop!!!  This should be ""tap and tap!!!"" Or an option to do so.

So many times I drag stuff from A to B only to see go back to A, because my finger jumped from moving too fast. SO ANNOYING.  This is enough to make me not want to play. Challenging is good, annoyance is not."
Love this app. So addicting.
Really fun to play!
Love this game
Love this game, love cooking games. It was fun until I felt the need to spend my money on gems just to play and get through the levels. It seems everyone else thinks that the amount of gems needed to simply get 3 stars in a level by one upgrade is riddddddicccuuulllooouuus.Please fix this. Please.
This game is addicting to me, I just started yesterday! If you like games similar to Diner Dash, this is the perfect match. Its super easy! I bought this automatic grill where it cooks the sausage and burgers by itself when you run out. If you upgrade your burger buns and hotdog buns, you get more money so if you don't get a lot of tips (they grey coins), you still get 3 stars. Now, I don't know much about the rest of the game but I've got a feeling its gonna be marvelous!
I'm 23 n absolutely love this game
I loved this game! But now I don't! It's impossible to upgrade without enough gems! Give us more GEMS!!!!!!!!!
This game is fun so far! It's like Cake Mania or Diner Dash. I have no complaints. :)
Great game.  A lot of fun to play but after the first levels it's impossible to earn the gems to continue on.
The game is very fun and addicting but I believe that the customers could wait a little bit longer especially on higher levels when there is a lot more people. Please please please fix that :-( other wise I'm thinking about deleting the game!
Easy to play and a nice game BUT I HATE these games where you have to keep buying stuff in order to play! I, however, am not one of those people who will so if I can't advance in the game any further, I will just delete it. Please bring back the games where you just paid up front and was able to play the game in its entirety.
It's fun but like all games it has free and payable up grades
Cool game
This game is so fun and addictive. I'm 18 years old and I can not out this game down for the life of me. Not only is it probably the best app on the App Store it's also really good for passing time. It's really easy and fun.! I could honestly go in all day about how amazing this app is but whose got time for that when you I could get back to this game!!! Love it defiantly worth the download!!!!!!!!!
Entertaining game.  I wish Microsoft offered it because I have to play on my iPhone.  I have a Surface as my tablet.
This is a really fun game but you have to pay real money to do anything. Need to refill your cupcakes? Pay $$$. Want to put a pinball machine in your restaurant? Pay $$$. Tired of making hot dogs and hamburgers and want to buy the bakery? Pay $$$. I would have gladly paid $1-$3 flat rate for a full unlocked version of this game, but the developers are greedy and I'm deleting it.
Enjoy playing this
I like this game. I never spend money on games. Up to level 16 with 3 stars on all levels with no money spent. Haven't gotten past first restaurant yet but fun for what it is. My only complaint is that the hit box for some of the items is very small. I play on an iPhone 4S so the screen is small and hard to click and drag that tiny little hit dog when you have to touch directly on it.
Awesome game! Addictive
I love everything about this game, except for the fact that once you get past the first restaurant, the app tries to make you pay actual money for gems! I think that's ridiculous.
Wow
If you don't mind paying to play this game is fun and creative! We love playing and getting to have different restaurants! Only wish is there were more opportunities to get diamonds without having to pay. Should be by skill level.
This game is an absolute rip off. Do not download it, it will never allow you to progress . RIP OFF RIP OFF RIP OFF
I don't think the gems are hard to earn. The game gives u free gems I have 20 gems and it is only my second day with the game! The game also gives you 5000 coins if you download their other game called: 25 games Gamebanjo, which  is also really AWSOME!!!!! You have to get now it is NOT A RIP OFF!
Bottom line: fix this gem situation.  It makes the game NOT fun. Look to your predecessors on how to use a currency/bonus system (I.e. Order UP) cause your system blows.
I really enjoy this game, though it may be difficult at time due to the small screen I am on, that doesn't deter from my enjoyment of it.
This game is so addicting I play the levels till I'm at   Like 9 ,19  and what for the tens I'm on this game all day but here are some doubts u can get coims by downloading that game and you have the money for a lot of stuff but you need gems a lot of gemstone buy so here's what I do I just by the stuff that just need coins
So addictive. I love it!
Boring gAme
This game would be amazing if they lower the prices of gems . You can really beat levels or buy new resturants if you need 100000 gems to move on. Thumbs down<f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008E>
I would give this game 5 stars if there was a way to earn more gems within the game. It's a fun, challenging game, but you get stuck quickly when you run out of gems and every update that will actually make a difference costs 10+ gems. I'm at a point where I earn 2 gems a day for opening the game and 7 gems when I advance to the next level, but getting to the next level now takes a LONG time. The casino is a joke really...I've bet thousands of coins there and have won maybe 8 gems. I have bought some gems, but it's quickly becoming apparent that as you get to the more advanced restaurants, upgrades take even more gems! Be fair Nordcurrent...you should be able to beat this game without spending hundreds of dollars (how ridiculous does that sound?!), it should just be more difficult and take longer. I'm done buying gems. I do enjoy the game play though, so I think I'll stick around until you change your ways. Put some ads in the game even! I'd even pay $2-$3 for a paid version of the game if it offered more ways to earn significant amounts of gems.
Fun game until I noticed that my gems would mysteriously disappear without any purchases...
Nice
I have played many games that were free downloads and with patience was able to play the whole game for free. It is ABSOLUTELY not possible to do that here. And quick calculations of the gems needed would cost over $20 which is ridiculous for a game app. Save your time and money. Enjoy the first restaurant and part of the second restaurant and then move on!
Another "free" game that find tricky and underhanded ways of getting your real money.
This game really entertains me
Omg I just can't stop playing cx this game is so addicting :) for all you multitaskers this is the game for you!! :D
Great
I love this game!!! The upgrades are costly and it's not very easy to earn the gems that are required to upgrade things and buy new restaurants. But other than that, it's a GREAT game.
Yay
I love the gameplay but the gem thing is ridiculous !!!
I love this game.....
"It says it's a free app when really you're paying to play- you have to buy gems in order to upgrade things that you need in order to beat levels. They give you free gems when you level up but only about 6 when to upgrade things it's 5-20 gems just for one thing. It's ridiculous and is impossible to beat the later levels at the other restaurants without paying money, it's a waste. At first I really really enjoyed it until I got to the second restaurant and everything required gems to upgrade- then I couldn't beat any levels. Another problem is the game doesn't respond very well when it comes to moving icons where they need to go. My food has burnt so many times during levels which makes it so hard to beat just because the game doesn't respond. Not to mention it'll freeze then when it unfreezes it's burnt which causes you to not get 3 stars or lose the level.
 This is the only game I have that does that. All my other games work perfectly and respond fine. Also, the icons are way way too small. I'm a small person with really small fingers and I can barely touch the right icon that's needed which causes me to mess up a lot because the icons are so small and squished together. Over all, don't download. You'll get a good 20 minutes of enjoyment at first but after it's a complete rip off. I deleted it."
That's a lie..! Don't listen to me cx lol
I absolutely LOVE this game. It is so addicting. I'm 23, and I downloaded this game 2 days ago. I'm already at the second shop. My only complaint is the gems. There are not enough. If I may make a suggestion; It would be great if instead of only cash, you got diamonds for certain Achievements you have completed, or as the bonus when you finish a level. I say this because you already get coins for completing a level anyway, and I am always short on diamonds for my updates or buying a shop. Either that, or do not make diamonds required for updates. Thank you, and please keep the levels coming!!
I like it
You don't have to pay to play the game just have a little skill to upgrade takes a little time and set of just spending money to upgrade but all in all I think it's a pretty fun game.
I enjoyed playing this!
How about only allowing condiments when meat has been placed on bun?
It's an enjoyable game. It's everything I expected.
Awesome. Easy. Fun. Addictive. I've been searching for a game just like this. Invest properly and you won't have to spend a dime for your diamonds! Thank you! This is even the first time I wrote a review for any game!
This a really fun game! I am a huge Diner Dash fan, but I think I like this game even better!!!
The gems are too much I do enjoy the game but I'm thinking about deleting it on both iPads and my iPhone because of the gems.
Fun & addicting game, but after the 1st restaurant you need gems to upgrade almost everything!
Can not put down
This is so awesome best game ever play it
This game is usable for kids 8+ ages. Not very entertaining in my opinion.
funnest game ever!!! I downloaded it out of random and am obsessed with it now!
I would rate 5star if only gems where easier to get in bulk amount. Its really annoying everything requires gems which is really nuisance. Please make the changes!! Everything is awesome about this game except the gems thingy, lot of gems are required i mean thats not fair everything is too expensive. All items requires cash and gems very annoying and frustrating. This game should break the world record, "The most annoying game on earth" no offence but its too much. Everything is costly.
I do love this game, the graphics are good it doesn't lag and its extremely fun to play. However, the issue I have, like many others who have reviewed the game is the gems. The fun if the game is to play levels and gain your accomplishments but 6 gems isn't enough especially when most upgrades need 7. I think if more gems were given or there was better ways to earn gems without paying this game would be perfect. Right now it's a point of frustration should I delete the game or continue playing and hope that I get more gems eventually. Please do fix the gems issue.
"Upgrades should be able to be purchased by coins or diamonds,not just diamonds only.
By the way, i used to play this game every day until the upgrade."
Just what I needed....another game to be addicted to. Keeps my mind sharp trying to stay ahead of the orders.
This game is very frustrating, gems are too hard to get.
"To be honest with you.......IM ADDICTED 
It's amazingly fun"
O.K. When I bought the game it looked SUPER fun- and I still is. My only problem is that it it cost "gems" to buy new restaurants and level up your supplies... Gems cost $. Still super fun game!!
I think this is fun but you have to pay for gems to upgrade stuff.But if you do you good on levels you can get get lots of gems.
I love this game.
It's an fun game until yu have to spend money to get gems.. They shud hav a way other then leveling up or buying gems to get gems.. This is an app not a Xbox nor play station.. Yall need to fix THT problem
Yes I know that there are things they try to get you to buy in this game but that is unfortunately the trend with all games now days. " curse the brilliant person that thought of it". But when I started playing this game I went to level in a few hours and never paid a dime. You can get free coins by watching videos and installing apps. The diamonds you need I just save them up. You don't have to pay to play. And it is sooooo much fun !
Love this game
How are we supposed to advance if we have to pay money to get gems? There need to be better, easier, CHEAPER, ways to get them!
Makers are way too greedy... Enough said.
This game is so fun I was literally dying of boredom trying to find new games to play and when I started this I was hooked. This game is so fun. I love it<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008D>
I love it. It's super fun!!!
Sometimes to get extra coins this game will have offers where if you download a certain app, you will receive a certain amount of coins. Some of these apps are not free, and to not receive coins in return is upsetting. This is a case that can be taken to court if not taken care of. Just an FYI
Nice graphics and cool gameplay. I like the way you do not have to constant purchase items because of the amount coins and gems the game give you when you level up.
Fun at first but then can't get past a certain point because you can't earn enough gems. I will never spend $50-$100 on any kind of app. Looks like the makers have put in their own reviews to get a better rating on this game. Don't waste your time or money.
I have been looking for just a fun restaurant cooking game.THIS IS IT. This is so fun there are lots of levels and things to unlock and different places "to work" I recommend this game a lot!
It's a ok game I wouldn't say it's all that fun cause its not like u have to upgrade ever time u get don't with a game and it makes u bye stuff with your money knowing u want to save it...
My sister is addicted to this game
It's like dinner dash with a spin!
I downloaded it not to long ago. It's a good game so far l
I love to play cooking games and this game is addictive. Just wish it was available on other devices as well.
So far it seems to be a good game. Fun and a bit addictive.
Best game by far
Good game.  Reminiscent of the Cake Mania days.
I am so hooked, I can't stop playing
I loooove this game, it's fantastic and so addictive but you can't play unless you pay with real money. Give more chances to get diamonds. Stop being so greedy!
Lovee this game. Excellent and challenging. :o)
Eh
I don't know why people like to complain about some games are not "free".  People had invested a lot of time and hard work to create an app and they deserve some form of reward.  I had played the game for a while and I managed to unlock five restaurants without spending money to buy diamonds.  If you don't want to spend $$, then you have to be patient.
Very nice game to play when wasting time.
I like this game it rocks
Why yes the game is free and I liked this game for the first store but then the second store requires you to spend money to upgrade anything.  Don't bother!!!!!
Great
Game is lots of fun. Only complaint are the gems
Add more ways to earn gems or allow players to exchange a certain number of coins for gems.
Pretty fun game so far
This game is great however i have looked at everyone else's reviews and I have come to the conclusion that diamonds need to be saved so please developers make the casino or anything better for us to get more diamonds such as when I spend 500 cash in the casino I'll get 75 in a 100 chance or if I spend 100 cash I'll get a 30 in a 100 chance and so on also leveling up is a great achievement especially after lvl 18 so diamond rewards should go up.In conclusion you should save up diamonds for the auto cookers and for the devs please had more diamonds
Stop with the gems
I started playing this game maybe around the end of October and at first I loved it. Now it's just frustrating and expensive. I got past the starter restaurant with ease, but I've been stuck on restaurant 2, the Bakery, for about 2 weeks now, and the only reason I can't get past it, is because I need to upgrade a lot of things which cost a lot of gems, that I can't get. I've spent more than 100,000 coins in the casino just to end up with maybe a total of 5,000. I've only gotten 15 gems once in one spin from 500 coins, and never got it again. I get 0 gems when spinning that stupid thing. Something needs to be done about it and I know I'm not the only one who thinks so.
The game crashes every time I complete a level, so then I can't earn any coins.
Great game until you realize how much money you have to spend. This isn't PS4, this is an app and clearly the people making this app don't understand that. It is a great game until you get to the second level and realize how much money you'll have to spend to keep playing. I immediately deleted it and found a similar game that requires WAY less real money. If I were you I would lower the cost of everything because otherwise people are just going to delete your app and find a new one. Make your app more reasonably priced and people will want to stick around and play and will be willing to put some money into it, but this is just ridiculous. Never downloading or paying money to this app maker again.
"Usually, I am not one to download tons of games onto my phone, simply because most get boring after 2 days of playing them. This game however grabbed my immediate attention, and had me sneaking a play during work hours. UNTIL.....

The game turned over a new leaf and BOOM: showed it's true colors. You can earn a million coins and beat all levels, yes, but it wouldn't matter unless you had gems. Gems are what get you updates, and to open the other restaurants. There is no other option than BUYING gems. How ridiculous?! I mean, even instagram follower apps and other addicting games obviously have a way of earning their own version of gems for free, but this game stops you at a certain point, and you can't go anywhere without paying loads of cash. And it's not like even one purchase will give you enough to possibly beat the entire game itself, you have to go back and purchase MORE cause you'll earn any gems in the game anyways!

My point is do not bother wasting time here. It's sad, but the makers of this game are going to lose a lot of money. Yes, they may gain some cash now, but everyone here has gotten sick of it, and one day they'll be regretting the day they didn't play fair for their fans.

CHANGE YOUR WAYS, LET US EARN OUR GEMS."
This game is one of those games that can become addictive easily but it cost a lot "diamonds" aka cash to further on in the progress. I would say have a payment plan thing to where if you have certain amount of free coins saved up you should be able to upgrade or to buy a new shop. Or if you have an option to pay or to use coins to further on in the progress
I got sucked in for hours!
So addicting!
gave it a 4-star because it charges money for coins and diamonds. other than that super fun to play!
It rips me off. I've spent way over thousands of coins on it each time I play the slot and hardly ever win gems. What's the point of even having the slot if it jips you out. Also why does everything cost soo much gems? I understand u need to make money, but seeing how much every item costs with gems I can probably only buy 2 things. If things weren't so expensive I probably would consider using real money to help support your game. If ur not helping me, I won't help u. This is a very fun game and i am hooked but I'm starting to hate this game cause it's hard to enjoy when I use all my money earned just to waste it on the slot!
This is an awesome game, but I think you should either: lower the price of diamonds for upgrades or create another way to earn FREE diamonds. The APP is free why would I pay for anything else? Because of that I rate 4 stars.
I feel like there could be some kind of improvement to the gem issues, but overall nice!
"It's an addictive and fun game. My complaint like many of the structures of these games are to entice you to buy extras.  While I completely understand and support this practice, some game makers are a little more gracious in how they reward players without always having to purchase items.  

This game REALLY limits your abilities to advance without Gems.... And these are rarely given as a reward.  This company really gouges the customer more than other games.   At least let me convert some coins towards gems!!!   If it weren't for the limitations without purchasing, this would easily be 5 stars."
This game is very addicting, but after the first 16 levels of the fast-food restaurant,you basically get stuck. Unless you spend money of course, which my opinion is pointless. I wouldn't get this game if I were you.
Really like it <f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+0084>
Enjoyable game, I like that you don't have to spend money to advance
By looking at the name Cooking Fever, I have to download the game down and play. I love anything related to cooking games. This one, I would say it's a fun game to play and very addicting. First restaurant would be free but the kitchen upgrades use coins and gems. Second restaurant, you have to spend coins and gems to buy it. Every kitchen upgrades will use a lot of coins and gems too. I wish the upgrades wouldn't cost so much gems. Maybe 2-3 gems per upgrades would be great. Each levels up you will get gems. But those aren't enough to upgrades the kitchen. There are some free gems and free coins they would give you If you connect to facebook, twitter or invited friends. Others than that, I wouldn't spend money to get coins or gems.
This game has awesome potential and I might even purchase some gems once in a while but nothing is proportional. Also you can rack up tons and tons of coins and go to the casino but I've played it probably 50 times and only one twice. If the levels didn't advance so quickly and make it impossible to advance without spending money this would be an amazing game that would be worth a little investment.
I loved this game!!!!!

Fun game but you must pay to go anywhere & many of the next restaurants the expectations R impossible!! Unless you spend $$ to buy help by upgrading everything! It gets out of control quickly,sadly.
Often when you tap on an item, it doesn't notice. You have to try several times, and by then your burger is burned. But I keep playing!
This is a great game to play if you was bored
Addictive
I can't put this game down! HAHAHAHA!
really into this game!
This is cool
I'm loving the game. A lil addicted to it.
It's ok
Fun game, but not currently working right :-(
Minus the cooking time per customer, it's cool
So I'm 32 , live in Texas , have 4 children , work for a bank , a beautiful wife , and I absolutely love this game!! So educational and enforces Multitasking which so many people need to learn! Love love this application
Cool
AMAZING ADDITIVE ILOVEIT
good
gooooood
Really fun
This is a fun game
Having fun so far!
More diamond opportunities
Love it
Even though the game is fun any diamonds earned disappear when you close the game. even going back-and-forth between screens they disappear. please fix this
I'm enjoying playing this game
The game is okay but you never have enough diamonds to do anything always excess coins when you use the in the casino to hopefully get some diamonds that will never be the case. And it will take thousands before giving you one or two wins and it's always the one coins that's crazy like what the hell ? How is that fair ? Maybe if you guys weren't greedy you'd have a fair game for people to play and people to want to get into the game. Otherwise if give it a five star improvements need to be made tho
It fine u make upgrades cost jems but when u cant earn the jems in game its bs i deleting this game
After the first restaurant you realize that you can not play unless you are willing to pay up and buy gems in order to succeed .... Could get expensive! Don't waste your time in the casino. It only pays one time.
So far so good. I just started playing the game and im already addicted to it.
This game will cost money if you plan to continue to pay. Diamonds are barely given out, yet you need them to buy pretty much everything. The 2nd and 3rd level upgrades are expensive to it will take a long time to get what you need. You also have to purchase the next level restaurant with your money and diamonds which takes even longer. I bought some diamonds and cash but I just got a new phone and it didn't transfer. Because it wasn't backed up, there was nothing I could do. So I just deleted it.
Really fun game. I'm only on the first level so we'll see if the others are annoying ploys for money.. Hope not!
The company just wants your money badly. If you want to play the game well, you have to use real money to buy the gems in the game. Not worth it!!
Dddggf
Give out more diamonds dammit
Just got but having so much fun.  Also challenging trying to keep up.
This is the first game I love to play everyday
"In the breakfast level there's a glitch that won't let you put beans on the plate in the second row. Please fix.

Otherwise great game. Don't have to pay if you keep at it!"
I would like this game more if it didnt frezzeing on me and every time I play and upgrade i need diamonds and there's not enough for this get your'll need to fix alot of things on this game if u want someone to stay on its game.
This game is fun and addicting but I'm ready to delete it. I want to keep playing without paying money which is impossible since you need gems for everything but earn them sooo slowly. They should make it possible to buy gems with the money you earn in the game.
Wow
Great game super addicting but the gems are stupid you never get any and the casino you only when one time then never again other than that fun game to play
Good game worth the download
Didn't think this would be challenging, but after burning a few burgers, I found myself developing systems and prioritizing. Great game.
This game is fun & challenging for sure! However, very difficult to move thru levels w/out making purchases for Coin's & Gems which u WILL NEED to upgrade ur restaurant to complete levels successfully!
No
Fun, addicting.  But addiction wears quickly when you need tons of "diamonds" just to keep the game moving forward. "Diamonds" cost real money.  I don't mind if I had to pay a buck or 2, but you'll end up needing to pay a lot more to move forward in the game.  It's not ps4 quality to put $30-$70 into it.  It's an app.
I haven't played it<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0082> but I downloaded it for coins on this app but it didn't work so I'll give u some advice DONT DOWNLOAD FANCY LOCKS
"Fun game, sometimes you want a game
 you can just enjoy. This is it."
Great pastime. Very fun!
I really like this game but I wish you didn't have to buy so much gems in order to get to the other levels. I think they should really fix that in the next update because after ppl play the hamburger/hotdog level they will surely delete it if we are unable to get to the other levels without buying gems. This upsets me. Please change this.
before the update last month that included the Breakfast Cafe, there was a glitch with the casino where you could X out of it mid spin and when you opened it back up, you would win a bunch of gems every time. Now with the update, they fixed the glitch and now gems are impossible to get. Every upgrade requires 10 or more gems so its pointless to play this anymore. Played everyday and loved it, but its not worth spending $1,000's of real money just to play a game. RIP OFF.
I like this game because it's like diner dash. I like having to be quick and get things done. It's a fun game!
I love the concept of the game, but when you get to the harder levels, it's hard to do things because everything costa gems or coins. I went to the casino and I did about 92 spins and got 3 COINS! It's a good game and all but sometimes it's a bit frustrating.
"Pros: This game is very addicting and forces you to be strategic in your upgrades and linear play. The graphics are great, I especially love the instant gratification you get when you upgrade your food and it looks so good you want to eat it yourself!

Cons: I've actually purchased their popular gem back for $19.99... Twice. I soon realized that $40 bucks is not going to get you very far. It's about enough to fully upgrade one level. Not all of them, just one. That's a huge tug on your wallet for a game, despite how fun it is, is NOT worth that much. At the very least they should offer a timed discount for people that have already given them money to encourage continuous purchasing."
great game
Lots of fun!
It's a good game but since I've updated it I can play the level but it crashes immediately after and does not count my progress, I'm not playing anymore till this is fixed because it's a waste of time.
I was hooked on this game, played it non stop throughout the day. I unlocked most restaurants even the Breakfast Cafe. I was up to level 29 when I stopped playing for an hour or so and when I went back to the game the screen froze and stopped working. I restarted app and when I got back onto the homepage Breakfast Cafe was gone!!! I was beyond annoyed. I contacted customer service and they are no help finally when they answer they tell me to restart my phone I mean obviously I've done that and now they don't respond! I believe it was the update that messed it up and now I lost all the work I did. Customer support should be able to fix this !!!!
Lots of fun!
Nice app
It's okay as long as you don't have to buy all the stuff needed to continue then it is a total ripoff
1. it's free. 2. it's a cooking game ... it's a lot of fun . the only bad thing I have to say about this is that on an iPhone it is a little bit small . BUT that's OKAY ! very fun game , it's FREE do it :) !
It's a good game in theory if it didn't cost so much in. Diamonds to keep playing.
I love this game but they need to make gems more available how can you upgrade anything and earn any amount of exp points.
The game itself is great, I love those kinds of games. I just wish you didn't need so many gems to unlock stuff! And the casino... It's garbage! I've wasted so much money and got absolutely nothing from it. Super waste of time.
I love this game. It is a lot of fun but everyone is going to stop playing because you have to pay for EVERYTHING.
Don't be fooled, this game is really a pay to play.  By the time you hit the second restaurant, almost everything needs gems.  And it's impossible to beat the later levels without the upgrades.  You will end up spending 10 bucks or more on a game that is worth 2.99 at best.  Unfortunate, because it is actually a rather fun distraction.
I just started playing and I really like this game. Serving customers speeding to get the order right. I read some bad review about gems I haven't got to that part yet :)
Once you get to the cake shop, it takes to long to earn enough coins to get anywhere else. All coins have to go to upgrades in order to get 3 stars on every level...
#iiLoveIt
Nice game, but very expensive
funny funny
Very addicting!!!
Must be really quick. Fun!
It’s cute and fun, but after a certain point you’re going to have to pay for something. You need “gems” to buy upgrades and new stores and they don’t supply enough to keep going without needing to spend money. Also, lots of times the game didn’t respond to my requests to move things and pick things up. I’m not sure what that was, but it was pretty annoying.
It's A lot Of Fun,easy and It's Teaches How To Cook At A bar Grill!* Awesome!*
its awesome until the gems are required for everything
typical restaurant game. when dragging items it has to be directly on top which is annoying when u let go and it doesn't click on. great game for carpal tunnel.
It costs too many diamonds for many of the upgrades. Also, I'm having to drag items several times to get them served. The drop area for these should be larger.
cool
"At the Pizzeria you need gems to upgrade everything in the kitchen

In the slot machine it RARELY gives you any gems

6 gems for every XP level boost, gonna need more than just 6 gems if I'm gonna keep playing"
I'm sorry, since when is a game supposed to be beat in an hour? For those of you complaining about having to buy diamonds.. I've been playing this game for two months and I haven't spent a dime on it. The point of playing the game is having fun and accomplishment, so sit through and just earn the diamonds instead of being so quick to cry and want more! This game definitely deserves 5 stars!
Game is okay if you want to spend a lot of money to play.
Fun. But should give more free shops
Very entertaining!!!
You should get it
It's a good game except every time u upgrade and purchase new stores u have to use those blue diamonds I wish y'all stop because you don't give enough and sometimes people can't afford to buy it other than that it's a great game to play I recommend it to other people also I wish you would set it up for players who have friends playing the game could send each friend a diamond or 2
I was really enjoying this game at first but I only made it 8 levels because as the pace of the cooking picks up, the responsiveness did not follow. It was near impossible to move the icons around to where they needed to be. My phone is relatively new and I have never had a problem with responsiveness in any other game, so I can only assume the problem is this game. Very disappointed. Deleted the app immediately.
This game was fun until everything started costing a ridiculous amount of gems. You will get stuck around the middle of the second shop and that's where you will give up unless you're loaded. Way too expensive to do anything.
I upgraded my phone n lost everything!! all the $ I put into it and now what???
This game is so much fun and you will fall in love with it right away
This game is paid because is impossible play after some times without buy diamonds... Trash!
Great game to play...it lags too much       Make an update<<<< please
This game was awesome and addictive, but like others have said, after 2 places, you can't progress further without buying gems. And talk about a major imbalance, I have enough coins to last me and barely any gems! :( so sad I can't continue to the other places, I was excited for this game but it's all a tease unless you want to spend money :(
Totally addicting! <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0081>
This game is so addicting and too much fun!
This game is fun and addictive to play, only problem? You need to pay or patiently wait to gather 2 gems daily to be able to purchase all the necessary upgrades. This game is not for impatient and perfectionist people. If you are, stay away or you will most likely buy gems just to earn the 3 star ranking in every level. I love this game but I honestly don't want to wait/buy diamonds to fully enjoy it. Please lower the price and I'll give you a 5 star rating.
I love it
This game iS fun but wish there was away to earn more gems in the game.
Very addictive
Best game ever!!! So addicted!!
It's such a fun game but too bad they only want you to buy gems. There are too many awesome free games out there for me to be spending money in a fake business. <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1>

A diner game from a different angle, the kitchen, micromanaging your grill is immediately gratifying when successfully done, but the pacing of the customers is fast enough to keep you on your toes.
Addicting
Very fun
Crashed and took my money!!! Not worth it don't waste your time...... Nordcurrent was not helpful at all
Very time consuming and i just loveee cooking ganes especially like this !!
This game is awesome I'm like addicted to this game 5 star rating yasss
Awesome game!
Great game to play to past the time. I haven't paid for anything yet.
Funn to play
I love this game.. but it would be cool if we could hire an assistant ...
Ok ok
Awesome!!
nice game
Personally I like cooking games and this is one of my favorites. This app is very good considering it was a free app. I also like how it's challenging.
This game is NOT free, the first 40 levels are than you have to buy everything to continue! Which I find it every stupid I love this game so much & I would like to keep playing, but I can't pay every time just to unlock new levels..
I don't know why people say this is a bad game it really isn't so people do me a favor don't write a complaint write a compliment instead so go out there and BUY THIS GAME EVEN THOUGH ITS FREE!!!!!
Love this game
I just can't stop playing!!
I'm not a game person and never have time anyway. This game is so fun I make time for it!
I like that the game starts at a comfortable pace then increases with each level, allowing you to get familiar with the items/features. The upgrades are awesome makes serving customers easier and the game more enjoyable (though they are a bit too steep). The food burns too quickly as well, which is a problem because sometimes I have to try dragging the items more than once. Instead of dragging how about tapping. Ex: tap on a cooked sausage and then tap the sausage bun to place the sausage in it. Other than that, it's great a game and lots of fun!
It's a really fun and addicting game.. While you're on the burger joint level anyways. The casino is ridiculous, went 50 spins and won absolutely nothing. Waste of coins. After a point everything needs diamonds to upgrade or to go to a new restaurant. I understand the app developers need to make money from the games, but this is absurd. You only get 7 gems for leveling up wen interior and kitchen upgrades cost about 5-10 gems each. Levels are hard to play without the upgrades too. I think the developers are being WAY too greedy.
PLEASE fix the clunky touch & drag controls. It is painful to watch your food burn because you just can't drag the hot dog to the bun
if you want up high ,maybe you spend lots of money
Sooo much fun
I really didn't want to play this game at first, but THEN!!! Not at all what expected! This is a fun game! You can earn as much as you want and I don't have to wait until tomorrow for this to reload!! Finally a game for someone like me who gets bored very easily!
best app ever <f0><U+009F><U+0092><U+00AF>
Always need more gems to advance in the game. Slow to get if u don't want to spend actual money. That part is frustrating. Otherwise addicting.
This game is unlike any I've played recently; and Very interesting.
Love this game!! Highly addictive!
This game is fun an exciting I play it at work all the time, oops :) lol
Supper addicting and fun.
fun
This game is pretty killer. This is coming from someone who never writes reviews so that in itself makes a huge statement! I love that you can continuously play, there's no waiting or "asking for lives" nonsense. Love it!
I love this game! It is so fun!
Fun
"This game is off the huck
I just can't wait 4 MORE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
Man I can play this game all day
One of the better serving diner games I've played. There isn't any powers you use to play, so you don't have a limit of how long you can play. It does freeze every now and again, but not enough to subtract a star. Good game so far..
I love this game it is so fun I love how you can do all these really hard levels but they are really fun to play with.
At first I thought this game looked really dumb but after I installed it I thought it was really fun! It is easy to earn coins and upgrade your kitchen. There is no easy way to earn gems though, and when you get into harder levels it will requires gems to upgrade your stuff whatever it is. This is really frustrating because it will require coins AND gems! It is not a deal breaker for me, though and I play this game all the time. I recommend it to anyone on the fence about getting it! <f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008D><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0083>
Would be better if I can actually update my kitchen and diner with the coins I have instead of buying gems. What's the point of the coins if I can't use them.
This game is freaking awesome! I love this game. It gets challenging yet I have been playing it ever since I downloaded it. I RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO ANYBODY! :)
Addictive
I enjoy the variety in the game. A real fun challenge. Find the developers helpful with any issues that pop up!
it's bae<f0><U+009F><U+0099><U+008C>
There are very minimal ads that do not bother you at all. This is one of the few games where all the levels are free. It's challenging and addicting.
Wiped out 2 locations
I love love love this app! You don't need to spend any money off your own to get level up and cool upgrades but you can if you want to which is really cool. I love it! It's so addicting
TP
Fun game! I hate letting the customers down! Lol
I'm sure they've seen how many people are outraged with the idiotic gem idea mess. Yet they don't fix it. People have been writing reviews about the gems forever now and they obviously don't care. They updated the game today and I was hoping maybe the gem problem was the update but no. it was some other random pointless thing. Sorry but I refuse to spend that much money on an app, and I'm sure everyone else feels the same. You must be new at making apps because normally app developers aren't THIS greedy for money.
Fun but can be monotonous
I enjoy cooking games and this one seems to be very enjoyable and challenging;)
It's a cool game but really hard to play on my phone because the food is so hard to grab and drag to the customer. Please fix this.
"I think this game is so fun because it gets ur heart going and it is such a rush to get the orders to the customers. If u r thinking to get this game it is a great game to get

MARISA
DABOLL"
Where is the new restaurant?? CLEARLY says "with next update" and then there isn't one! It takes TOO LONG for new places to open up! I'm almost through the breakfast bar all 3 stars on 40 levels so HURRY UP! I love love this game, needs more places--keep them coming! Best "cooking" game out there!!
Loved it at first but I have only finished two levels and the amount of diamonds needed in the levels after is ridiculous so I'm searching for another similar game that doesn't require spending so much money
I love this game I can't get enough! <U+2764><U+FE0F> best and only game I have on my iPod <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008A>
So far im addicted
There is only so far you can go in this game with such a limited amount of gems, and the purchase price for the gems is ridiculous. I'd prefer to see ads and actually be able to move past the first two restaurants without selling my firstborn child.
I really really like it but don't like the new update with the gems. I can't get gems like that so I can my upgrade the tools
So far this game is really addicting and fun 5 stars all the way!<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0081><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0081>
Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
I luv this game!!!
I'm hooked.
I Love this Game... I got my friends addicted to it as well... It's jus that we need more way to make gems <f0><U+009F><U+0092><U+008E>
I found this game by mistake, and I'm very glad that I did. This game is very fun and it sucked me in from the beginning! I highly recommend this.
it is!!!
So much fun!!
Best cooking game on the market... Hands down
"This game is much like other cooking games, simple and fun!
You can make a variety of things and it's just a great free time user!
I would recommend!"
Best crapper game I've played in a long time!
This is a really fun game. The only thing i think should be changed a bit is how long the customers wait. Make them wait just a bit longer and also the food because they burnt out fast. Lastly i think it should also be coins to open a new location because it takes forever to get gems being that you have to use them to upgrade your kitchen!! I would appreciate if these changes were made possible!! Thanks!! <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0080>
Don't do it. It's addictive, great for time management skills but ultimately spending money is what needs to be done to go further in the game. It's not really a free download <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A9><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0086>
This game is so addicting I love it I've never just sat and played till my eyes cross and not get up to do anything lol this game is awesome!!!!
The game is fun but, you realize by the second restaurant that it's by no means FREE.  This game will cost you a lot of money to play.  Everything you do costs you diamonds which of course they do not give you even a quarter of what you would need so you have to buy them.   If almost everything didn't require diamonds it would be fun and I would continue playing but needing to buy diamonds the first day of playing just shows me how much this game would cost in the long run.  Especially there are only about six restaurants (which again you need 10 to up to 50 diamonds to open each one) so unless they add more restaurants the game will be done quickly.  Don't waste your time or money!!!!!
Great game!<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0083>
In love with this game.... I can't wait for the update!!! I'd like to be able win mor gems but this game rocks!!! Sometimes it won't let me drag food to the customers or the trash
I really enjoyed this game until I realized that the only way to get new levels was to pay gems. I understood paying 10 for the bakery, it seemed reasonable, but it just gets worse and worse from there. I'd give the game a better rating if they didn't cost so many gems.
You can stand on your own for a short time in the hot dog and burger shop, but from that point on, everything costs gems to access or upgrade. The shops, the kitchens, the interiors, everything. They even throw in special foods like cupcakes in each shop that just waste away what few gems you have... I guess, with the gameplay mechanics, they have no choice but to gouge you for every penny, you get just 1 gem every time you level. And maybe some casino gems of you're lucky. And 2 gems at the end of the week, while the upgrades cost 5-55gems...
I love this game!
Love This game!<U+2764><U+FE0F>
The title says it all! The only thing I don't like is that you run out of diamonds quickly yet need them for many upgrades for the kitchen and restaurant. It's not too bad because every time you level up, you get more!
Fix dexterity game! I work in the food industry and this is accurate! Fast paste multi tasking
I love this game because it is not a demo u can buy more shops I think that this is the best game I had ever played
Best cooking game ever!!!
I love the game I wish it was a little slower lol but it's FUN.
This game is super fun! It has so much levels and so much foods to pick from! The best part is that the levels get harder real slow! And the costumers give you time to cook things! You should download! 5 star rating!
I luv this game, but it requires way to many gems to make any progress in it. They give u free gems but not very often. The maker of this game would get better ratings if they lowered the amount of gems required to purchase things, otherwise I won't be playing much longer, bcuz I can't afford to buy anymore.
Cute concept, but it's just another money trap. Unable to progress after a few levels without buying Gems for real money.
I think this game is the coolest game I've ever seen.So I think everyone in the world should get it!Bye now!
This game is a must for those who love cooking games.
Love this game! It's awesome
I great way to pass time, while riding to work. It's challenging, but worth the play.
"Every game including the most likeable fifa 2015 they make u choose to purchase from the money u have or the dimond ! Only this game require dimond !!!! If u don't have that no matter what money u collected it's no use. 
Money sucker to buy more dimonds !"
"And the casino never gives GEMS!!! No matter how much u spend. 

I love love this game. It is very addicting lol and fun. I have my family playing also. The only thig I don't like that is makin me reconsider playing further are these gems. With having to use them for all these upgrades is crazy. I have spend thousands in the casino tryin to get gems and only don't so twice. I don't think it's fair to require so many gems and not have challenges or let the slot machine spit them out!"
When I first got the game it was great and I got all the way to level 38, but then it crashed on me. I figured it was normal, since games sometimes crash, and all my progress was still there. When I opened it and pressed play, it crashed again! I couldn't open it even after I updated it, I even deleted it and re-downloaded it, but that only made it buggier. SOMEONE FIX THIS!!!!!!!!!
This is a great cooking game! Holds your interest and provides great challenges.
I've been trying to write a review for the longest but it just wouldn't go through smh, this game is giving so much problems I worked so hard at getting the breakfast cafe and it won't even open even after this little update!
If you want a cool game you want a game were you get mony this is the game for you. P.s. buy it
This game is awesome but please give us more gems or at least more frequently! You can only upgrade things to the second level without spending a bunch of gems and some things you can't upgrade at all unless you use gems. I would give this game ten stars if this is fixed!!! But the game is super fun and addicting!! I've been replaying the hot dog/hamburger levels just to rack up coins and xp so I can get gems when I level up. I'm stuck halfway through the bakery because I'm out of gems and can't upgrade the equipment and interior without gems and without upgrading, my customers don't generate enough money to move on to the next level-it's a vicious cycle!! PLEASE GIVE US MORE GEMS SO WE CAN ADVANCE BEYOND THE SECOND RESTAURANT!!!! Because this game is super fun!!!
The new update has caused more problems, with All my accomplishments it deleted it all. The support team only thing gave back some of which was lost, but lied about sending the rest that was fully owed to me. I was patient long enough with all of this, with attitude from the staff and the misleading I just uninstalled and deleted the Game and informed the company I will not be playing with their product anymore.<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A9> very disappointing.
I understand that this is a free app, but the developers should include more ways to earn gems! This game was very fun and addicting at first, but as you progress the levels get harder and it is impossible to do well without upgrading by using gems! I have just uninstalled this app because it is no longer fun. Please do something about the gems.
Love this game it keeps you wanting to play and unlock more restaurants. Only thing I don't like is you have to buy a lot of gems to upgrade the products and buy more restaurants.
I'm not going to pay hundreds of dollars to get through a game that cost MAYBE a few bucks to create per player. Let's get real here, guys. Change gameplay or lose players, it's that simple.
This game is the best I play it all the time I love it
<U+C7BC><U+B0A8>
This game is fun but they force you to have to purchase coin or gem in order to complete levels or else its impossible for you to accomplish the game! They should at least give you the option to complete the game without making it so difficult if you dont want to in app purchase anything.
Fast paced!! <f0><U+009F><U+008C><U+009F><f0><U+009F><U+008C><U+009F>
My fave cooking game!!!
One of the best food games I've gotten! It's great!
Fun game!  You really feel like you are achieving something.
Great game
This game is super fun and addicting, but it is ridiculous the amount of gems they are requiring. I can't afford to spend money like that on a game. You can not get 3 stars on the levels as you progress to the second restaurant because you can not upgrade due to the amount of gems, along with the coins required.
So far it's a fun game
I think it's good but the only thin that's wrong is the customers Oder super fast<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A0><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A9><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00AB>
Very fun game haven't been able to put it down.
Keep you busy and think.
Fun and addicting ppl say it's impossible by 2nd level but I just started so I guess I'll see
Y'all talking about money that's the point of the game it wouldn't be fun if u need a little bit of money for something huge like give up and earn it
This is an awesome app,especially if you're good at multitasking!!
Addictive
"Total rip off after first restaurant, can't upgrade unless you have diamonds diamonds diamonds an the only way to get them is to complete levels many many times or buy them. an the casino is a ripoff as well, spend 30000 coins won 2300 coins back but NO diamonds. You judge 

Ps 
Here's an ideal how bout a converter coins for diamonds"
Cool game to play and relax with to take your mind off a crappy day
Need more jewels
This game is impossible to play ! Fix the lags ! Thumbs down to this game! <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1>
The game is fun but I refuse to actually spend real money on a GAME and in this game you are basically forced to buy gems in order to get farther.
Love this game but I have completed the food court level with three stars on all 40 levels and was have way finished with bakery level. Went back to play after doing update in IPad and I was back at beginning of game. Will be deleting no time to keep starting over. Definitely need to fix that big.
Hard but it is fine except after awhile it's impossible to get 3 stars
This app does not give you enough time or grills or anything to cook with that could feed all the people you get. If you ask me about this app I would say terrible not even in a million years would this app be good. Don't get this app it is a was't of time.
It's really fun to play and makes time fly by.
It is fun
yaaaaaassss
Very addicting :)
Don't like how you have to spend money so I doubt I'll stay long with it.  I don't ever plan to spend money
Very fun!
This game is impossible to play through without spending a crap ton of money. Save yourself the trouble and buy a 2 dollar app. Worthless.
I like this game
I really like this game. I think it's one of the better level games available. But I agree with the other reviewers - it relies too much on gems to help you get three stars or move up. I refuse to pay for gems so I have to rely on leveling up or playing consistently to get gems. I wish they would update the game and change this
Just started but got to say best cooling game  ever p.s.only reason for five star
I want to be a cook when I get older and this is a wonderful game. It challenges me and its really funny when the customers get mad.
Good fun game, entertaining
Love it but need more cash & gem reward amts.
It's fun very fun and so much fun that you get enjoyed with the rating pop up. Will you leave me alone now that I rated the game?
Very fun! Good game to play when you're bored or like games like cooking mama
Great game, but I'm with the other reviewers about the gems. I will, occasionally, spend money on games but not what they are asking. A buck for 10 gems. Really? No way would I spend that. And I'm pretty sure the slot machine is rigged.
The game is good but I try to hit the menu button or any other thing and it freezes I can move around to see my surroundings but that's pretty much it I can even play or anything. Not anymore
This game is awesome! Very nice interface and amazing concept. Love it! 5 stars any day.
So fun
A lot of fun!!
This is a really fun game, but I'm having issues trying to earn gems. Maybe you can have other mini games aside from the casino since it's so hard to win there, or allow us to exchange coins for gems. You could also let us watch videos to earn gems. Hope you take this into consideration
Just started game a few days ago and love it. Passed the burger level nicely, earning coins and gems to upgrade kitchen and facility. Now I'm on the bakery and can't upgrade because of the lack of gems. I can pass levels but struggle to get 3 stars because of the lack of upgrades.  Going to the casino to earn gems is a joke...I won the 3rd spin I did and haven't won since. Aside from leveling up, the casino is the only way I know to earn gems. I refuse to pay money, especially this early on in the game.
My burger joint is on point! :) I actually really am having a good time playing! I like that you can upgrade all of your appliances, and quality of food.
I think this game is ok there just isn't enough food to get and upgrade there needs to be more upgrades
Good game so far just wish upgrades wasn't as expensive
Improve your waitress skills
This game is very addicting love playing it
This is the best game I have ever played in a very long time! It is so fun and really really reall addicting. I have to go... (And play cooking fever)
I love this game. I have spent some time on it. And yet I still haven't figured out why on the bakery that you have to pay 5000 dollars AND 10 gems. I got confused but I figured it out. I can't help but beg my parents to let me buy stuff off of the AppStore like this.  Eventually they let me. So thank you again for inventing this very fun game.
Decent enough game. Fast paced, makes you think, but I don't like that it's been about a week and a half, mad I already made it to the point where I need to pay money to play on.
Very fun game, and I'm glad it doesn't cost any money.  Addictive.
Fun to play while you have some downtime and entertaining. Each time you play you get enough money to upgrade your restaurant.
Great app! Oddly, having fun!
This game is so addictive I can't stop playing please make more games like this
It's so fun hurry get it now <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008F>
it's a really good game! I play everyday!
Fun game so far
<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0098><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008D><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+009C>
Fun game, however, all purchases use gems even though it gives the impression that you can use coins. There is no possible way to go beyond the first diner without using actual money to purchase gems to move forward. Wouldn't bother downloading unless you intend to spend money.
Super cool graphics & all but there should be more ways to get gems. Or less things that require gems.
Lo amoooo
Funny game
Fun Game!!
A great game to pass time...great graphics & more interesting than most cooking games!!
This game is the best. I love it so much. Also it is very easy. You make virtual food then get money and tips. You can sell <f0><U+009F><U+008D><U+0094>s! Best game ever! This game is horrible because it is very addictive! Your eyes will stare at the screen and will hurt ur eyes because the game is off the chain! GET THE GAME!
Reminds me of dinner dash but it's a lot more intense and stressful lol
"This game is very fun and addictive...but this game is too dependent on gems and that would lead to buying more and more 
gems, which gets expensive. After upgrading your items to lvl 2 or 3 it will cost at least 5 gems. They give you gems when you lvl up, but you have to keep playing. For some people it will annoying when you want to lvl stuff up, but you need more gems."
The game is a great way to not get board it is really nice to see the costumers smile
Haven't won any gems while wagering 500 in the casino since the last update. Fix this and I'll return rating to 5 stars.
It's the best
Great game.
Not everyone can afford to pay real money for much needed gems in this game...
Way to many gems needed to move on to another shop!!!! Just plain stupid.
I was really enjoying this game- until I got stuck in the gem rut!! They hard to come by and needed to upgrade. I'm not that stupid as to buy them. Please fix this! Otherwise the game is fun
Like this game fun to play.
"I spent ages looking for a new ""Diner Dash/Cake Mania"" type game. I came across Cooking Fever, and I love it! Gameplay is simple, yet effective. Definitely an addictive game with nice graphics. I'm yet to experience any technical difficulties.

The only issue is levelling up once you get to the higher levels. I am now a level 13, and the game requires ""gems"" to upgrade equipment or to move on to more locations. Gems were initially easy to come by as I was levelling up so quickly. However, as the XP needed to level up climbs steadily higher, gems become more elusive. This causes for frustrating gameplay, and sadly for me, has caused me to look elsewhere to get my fix.

I would much rather pay money for the game and not have to bother about gems.

I'm sorry, Cooking Fever, but I'm going back to Diner Dash."
Love the game, love it. It's just too difficult to acquire gems! I need 20 to buy my 3rd shop and I have maybe 2? Which you need to upgrade items, to complete levels better, to get more experience, to get more gems! It's a big circle.
Love playing this
Don't loose you game users..ppl r getting annoyed by upgrading with gems !! So please fix it, I don't think any stupid will buy gems with real money
Love to spend times with <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008D><U+2764><U+FE0F>
I like the game but when my brother and I  play it at the Same time mine restarted and I got really angry because now I'm n his game which I don't like because I was very successful and he started a couple of days ago. So I would like for u to fix it because I told lots of people about this game which u get money on. FIX IT NOWWWW
Reminds me of my youth!
"It's a great game. Gets harder to select and drag things when it's busy. Needs bugs fixed.
Gems are harder to come by after the first burger joint is complete"
There should be a way to get more gems because you need them a lot, but they don't give you much
Good game have had fun with it.
It is an awesome game takes a while to get money and to buy coins is a lot
When I first downloaded the game it was good you could cheat and get extra gems through the casino but now as they have change it and it takes forever to get awarded new gems and takes even longer to finish a restaurant.
There's something about cooking food and serving it in a game that is satisfying. Good one
I really like this game, but unless you're willing to fork out a lot of cash, it's unplayable beyond the halfway point of level 2. The kitchen upgrades needed to decrease cooking times and serve amounts suddenly start costing diamonds as well as coins, and at this point it would take 100 diamonds just to get 1st and 2nd level upgrades. To cover that amount would cost $12.99 (in Australia) real money. I realise that Apple have unfairly targetted Australia for a 70% geography surcharge, so the price will differ in less geographically challenged regions. Even so, that's just for the 1st and second level upgrades, and the upgrade level maxs out at 3. It also costs to buy new restaurant levels, starting at 10 diamonds and up to 50 diamonds for each new restaurant. All up it costs (so far), 160 diamonds just to get all the restaurants. And then each of those restaurants need kitchen and dining room upgrades that get progressively more expensive. So the in-app diamond package that might cover all this is $130, which i'm sorry i would struggle to justify spending on a real video game, not a tiny time management game that would cost maybe $20 as a pc game in a store. These sorts of apps just come across as money hungry and greedy. I'd be willing to pay a nominal amount to unlock levels, but the cost to play this game is unreasonable for what it is and i will be deleting it.
I love this game because it is really fun cooking and trying not to burn the food. I recommend it!
This is a great game that is plenty of fun. Yes, you have to use the money and gems you earn to upgrade your restaurants, but that's the point of the game and it only makes it more and more enjoyable every time you unlock more features!
This game itself is very fun and challenging but the issue with upgrading is the problem. Everything almost requires gem to upgrade and there is no way I am paying gems for just an upgrade. The gems are really difficult to obtain because there is only winning through the casino which the chances are very rare or leveling up or paying real money. Please fix this
The game is quite good to play.  But if you dont want to buy the diamonds and try to win them on the slot machine you have fat chance.   I have spent 5 weeks trying to get the two or three diamonds every day.  I won't buy them out of principle now. Only won diamonds  4x playing several times a day. Rip off!
I like the game. It's fun, but the gems are so hard to get. At least make them easier to win at the casino. Even better, allow us to convert our coins  into gems, then you might get more people to play your games.
"Gems needed for upgrades are ridiculously expensive for the benefit they give.  U can try and win on slot machine but even though it shows two and three gems as possible I have spent hundreds of thousands of (game) dollars and can only randomly get one gem line (15 gems). 
I don't mind buying a few gems here and there to get past a level but the minor improvement is not worth the amount of money when it's 20 or so gems. Waiting wayyyyy too long for new shops."
You need gems to level up and advance through the game. Problem is, this game doesn't reward you with many gems for playing - 7 gems for playing more than 10 levels and one small upgrade is about 14 or more gems. So unless you want to play the same level over and over and over, then you have to BUY gems - and they're not cheap either! $24.99 for 300 which will buy you half the upgrades to ONE restaurant if you're lucky. I've spent 30,000 coins at the casino and not won a single gem, so don't count on winning them either. So I'd recommend this game for people looking to spend $300 on a game appinstead of buying a playstation or if you love getting cheated of your money.
I love this game
Love it. Great game
Great game very addictive !
"Do not play this game. You will be disappointed. 
The game was really fun at first however after completing the fast food place and going to the bakery it has become a chore. 

In order to upgrade equipment you need gems. Not just one or two but 7 or 10 just for one machine. 

Gems are too hard to get. You need to pay for them with real money. Levelling up takes a long time and the casino is a joke. 

There is no point to continue playing."
I like this game but there's not much point unless you want to spend a bunch of cash buying gems. Otherwise you will likely just end up frustrated and playing the same boring levels over and over again, trying to earn enough gems to progress - So starts fun but them turns out frustrating and annoying
Now I can't even load into the main menu since the last updat<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+009F><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+009F><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+009F><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+009F><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+009F><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+009F>
Good game play and looks good. However once you get to the bakery it takes 5, 10, 20 gems to upgrade stuff or move on to the other restaurants. Your only option is hours and hours of replaying the levels to slowly level up or spend real money to buy gems which are ridiculously expensive.
Love it <U+2764><U+FE0F>
Great game, bit of a challenge in later levels but still great.
Okay but way to easy, no challenge
Love it
Excellent game although sometimes it freezes and won't let u give food to certain customers. Very frustrating as they walk out and I lose $
"The game is fun and addicting until you've finished the food court. The moment you start on the bakery everything costs gems, and not just 1 or 2 but 10 each time. 
Only being able to get gems by levelling up or the casino unless you want to spend real money makes it extremely difficult if it takes 3 levels (which take ages to get) to afford just 1 upgrade. 
I've spent well over 20,000 coins in the casino trying to win more gems and haven't won a thing yet. 
$24.99 for 300 gems?! It's ridiculously priced, I wouldn't even pay that much for the game if you didn't need gems to upgrade. With the amount of gems you need to upgrade anything that 300 is only likely to get you through the bakery level, yet alone any other stages. 
Please get more realistic here, people aren't going to spend $100+ just to be able to get through the whole game, I won't even pay that for big name computer games, no way I would for a little mobile game."
Good game, lots like it but its easy, and doesn't need your wallet for life support. 9/10 because no game is perfect ;D
Like it
"This is a great game that is fun and challenging. But like all free games there is an in game currency that is impossible to get without spending real money. Without gems you can't progress, and they make it hard to get. 

And what's the deal with using up so much data? I used up 70mb just playing, not watching videos or connecting to the store. Turn wifi off your device before playing!!"
A good game but requires too many gems for upgrades, which makes it hard to progress. Gems should only be an alternative to using coins
Just AWESOME!!!!!!!
Good game
It's insane that I thrown 30k coins in the casino and got 0 gems!
Really disappointed with this game. The first restaurant is made easy to pass. When you get to the bakery (second group of levels) everything is so much more expensive than the previous restaurant that it's near impossible to continue playing without spending real money. Don't be sucked into this ploy!!
I love this game soo much it's soo fun to play!<f0><U+009F><U+008D><U+0095><f0><U+009F><U+008D><U+0094><f0><U+009F><U+008D><U+009F><f0><U+009F><U+008D><U+0097><f0><U+009F><U+008D><U+0096><f0><U+009F><U+008D><U+009D>
So addictive! Needs your full concentration and you learn about multi-tasking at its fullest!
The gems are WAY too hard to get which means the game is unplayable. Why don't you listen to your customers reviews because everyone is saying the same thing. At least lets us use our coins to get gems. Not playing until this is fixed
I love it it's a great game makes me addicted to it it's just great game
Its a really good game def recomwnded!
Great, fun game but keeps making my phone freeze, I've needed to reset my phone 3 times in 2 days from it freezing in the app.
!!!

Love the game so far! However im finding it hard to click on things sometimes it would be great it it were more zoomed in
Really good game enjoy playing it, keeps me entertained and pretty realistic and intense !!
"I love the game
But think it needs to be easier to get gems not everyone has the money to buy gems and I can only get free gems if people on my friends list in fb accept the game request which they won't.. So right now sting the game is useless with out gems.. Need more gems!"
Highly addictive game. Only problem is that you need to acquire a lot of gem to continue with the game.
This is is so awsome but to make it more awsome you U add a selection of prawns to the list and cookies oh and plz plz plz could you add new people cos it's getting blurring with the same people ans add the cookies so a kid can by somthing with there mum/dad that is all for now
"Hummmppphhhh. I love this game but gems are sooo hard to come by. The casino is ridiculously expensive and I've only ever won15 gems. 
PLEASE make it easier to get gems to unlock new restaurants. At least remove the gems when upgrading within the restaurant. I'm getting bored of doing the same level to level...."
It's a really good game, but I don't know why the app keeps crushing since I have had my second store on level 26, and I can't keep playing because of this.
I actually like this game. It focuses on forward planning and it's fun <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0084><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0084><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0084>
Great app
Good game
O..o'
This app is great, if you like cake mania, this is the same sort of game that will keep you entertained for hours!
Cool
Goooood!
The breakfast cafe won't open now that I've unlocked it, and gems are too expensive so I can't buy another restaurant. Loved this game until this happened
Good game!
Love this game
I like the game but you need to many gems for every purchase so why bother
I dont know what happened but im playinh my newly updated indian diner, but suddenly the game crash. And when i open it, the diner is nit yet uodated. I went to the app store to update again, but there are no uldate availavble.. But overaall its fun
I LOVE this game, but absolutely HATE the fact that it costs so damn much to do upgrades with gems when they're very rare, need to work on this!!
I have completed Indian Diner level. After latest update, I bought and played the Breakfast Cafe. Suddenly today, the Indian and Breakfast restaurant got completely wiped out, written on both 'Coming Soon in the next update" weird!!! Love the game but too many error.
Fun and addicted
Great work! Please fix some bugs!
Pricey gems. :(
The game is lots of fun and addictive but high demand of gems for upgrade and new restaurants make it too tough. I refuse to spend real money on games and probably won't get much further as a result. Please fix the gem issue!!!
Good game <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0084>
Love this game but I'm about to give up because they're making it way too hard to progress in the game. I'm sick of playing the same boring level over and over because I can't upgrade anything without any gems. It's just a marketing gimmick to get people to fork out real money for gem packs which will barely allow you upgrade a soup pot. Because 15 gems to upgrade a soup pot, really?!
I think it's a great game
I love this game and have finished all my restaurants was waiting for the breakfast cafe, now I've updated and my whole app isn't opening. Also gems are too hard to get and need them for almost everything.
"I have been waiting so long for the breakfast level! Can't wait to play it. 

I've been playing this game for a lil while now and finished all the levels except the breakfast one and although it is rather expensive to get gems this game is super fun and VERY addictive."
Great game for those who like to micro-manage! The only downside is that progression is difficult without premium currency. Not impossible, but repetitive play is needed to gain the gems in-game to buy the upgrades to dishes, the café layout, and the new cafés.
This is my fav game but I wish it wasn't so expensive :(
"I really like this game, but it hate how when you need to upgrade something good. It takes too many diamonds to get it and to buy new shops. The amount of diamonds you need is ridiculous!!
If you need so many diamonds, you give a few more away!"
My partner and I love this game, the only problem is the gems. Too rare but too needed, and a lot of us don't have the money to spend real currency on them. Getting them in the casino is extremely rare too, so maybe ask for less gems on simple upgrades? Hard to progress forward with only getting gems when levelling up, and even then it's not that much.
The games good but after a while it gets really boring
Go to the slot building. Bet the highest amount and exit. Enter the building again. Viola.
Ridiculous costs to progress in the game! I give up!!!!
Great game. So fun. But I got so addicted and to even pass simple levels you have to upgrade your kitchen and/or interior. I've spent a lot of money on this game <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00B3>
Decent game. Doesn't always respond immediately to what you are tapping on. Average.
This game is awesome and I could spend hours playing it because it is so entertaining!!!<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+009D>
Love the game. Playing for the second time. Ran out of levels so I've reset
Like it very much
Hi guys I'm not sure if this is happening to anyone else. I'm on level 29 in the pizzeria well just wanting to get all 3 stars but as I soon as I put in the 3rd pizza the game shuts off!?! Really annoying !
Keeps restarting and I loose all progress This is very frustrating
Easy to use and very entertaining.
"Well, well well. Finally a game I can play on the go that doesn't need a internet connection, and is simple, fun and enjoyable. 

Highly recommended! 
<f0><U+009F><U+008D><U+0094><f0><U+009F><U+008D><U+009F><f0><U+009F><U+008D><U+0097><f0><U+009F><U+008D><U+0095><f0><U+009F><U+008D><U+00A6>"
Good but PLZ fix bug with iCloud. It is getting soooooooo annoying now
Simple and fun, i love it
I have been playing this game for well over 3 or so months, jumped on today to get my free 2 gems daily as it's the only way to get upgrades as the casino is hopeless for gems, and it's like the game has restarted and I now have to start from scratch. Took my ages to get as far as I did and now all my progress has been lost. So so frustrating, why has it done this. Wanting answers!!!
Good game for young and old.
"I love how there are soo many levels in this game ! Sometimes it can get a bit repetitive though :/ 
The main concern is the gems ! Without fail you have to buy them to proceed ! So far I have spent more than 200 gems and haven't got much :/"
"I've been addicted to this game for some months now. There are ways to get gems, you just have to be persistent. Doesn't release enough gems to jump through levels quickly though.
Fun though and good illustrations"
Best game so far
Been playing this game for a few weeks and had reached the Indian Restaurant and was enjoying it very much. Today it decided I was a new player and went back to the start, nothing I do puts me back where I was, very disappointing game, would rate it as zero but it won't let me.
Good game to pass time.
I like the game but expensive to upgrade and can't get into Indian restaurant (even though I purchased more gems to open it up!) because of suspected bugs in the game! Annoying :(
I've only had this game for a short time and I already love it. The graphics are cool and this game is very addictive. I suggest you get this game<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0084>
Since the update, the casino is no longer paying out gems. This is annoying as I cannot progress further in the game without them. There is no way I am paying for more
Click on the apple pie in the Pizzaria - cuts right out of the game. Fix. It. <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0092>
Great
Love the game but too expensive to upgrade on the tools and stuff.
Love the game but the gem situation is ridiculous. You can barely get through the game as all the upgrades require gems and its not just 1 or 2 gems but 20 plus to upgrade. I have read a lot of the other reviews and everyone seems to have the same opinion so please take note and fix it in the new update.
Totally obsessed, it's it sad.
Great game. Hours of fun for all the family. Great work.
Amazing game! Worth downloading!
AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!! It is sooooo good! Like, seriously, u cant get any decent apps on the iPad anymore! But THIS!!! This is great!!!!! It is seriously the best game that I have ever downloaded!!!!
Addicting game! I love it..
Loved it
Great game but you should put a $1 or $2 charge on it and give more gems in level ups and still offer gems for money if people wish to progress faster... I don't mind spending up to $5 on a game but for this game $5 would only last you one restaurant... Too greedy in my opinion. I might still play until it is impossible to level but very hesitant to buy gems when there are so many games that offer free gameplay or longer  thrills for a dollar or two...
"I love this game and everyone should have it. I give it a 10 out of 10!!!!! 
AWESOME"
Very good game definitely recommend it:)
I love time management games and I thought this was going to be fun. It was until I realised there was no way to earn gems. I knew there were in app purchases, but come on...this is getting ridiculous. I would have happily paid outright for the game, but developers would rather screw us over. It's a really fun game but those in app purchases really tick me off. I'll give it 5 stars if I can buy it outright.
It is an amazing game I love it so much!!
Best game ever
This is my favourite game it is so much fun you have to get it!!!
Haha it's incredibly addictive and fun!
Since updating to iOS 8 the app no longer loads which means I lose my 2 gems for daily use which I need considering you guys fixed the poker machine to hardly ever give out gems now which was the only way to earn gems to buy the ridiculously expensive upgrades
"...
...I'm speechless!
THAT'S how good it is!!!!!!"
Gd
best game on app market must play
I love the game but am getting tired of waiting months at a time for new levels.
I upgraded my apple pies on pizzaria and everytime I go to use one the game just cuts out on me! So annoying now I don't even mean to but accidentally bump it sometimes and my game just disappears. Very frustrating need to fix this bug
Great game I love it... Very addictive but like everyone else you have to work out this thing about the gems because it's stupid how use have done it!
Awesome!
Love this app so much !!!
This game is the best cooking game ever.it can get frustrating some times when you do get money to go up. But if I like it you should like it to
Addictive game
I love this game it is to addictive!! And this game is FABULOUS!!! I give this game 5/5 because it is challenging and great!! And is you don't like this game YOUR CRAZY!!!!!!!!! I don't know about you but I love this game<f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008D><f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008D><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0083><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0083>
This is a fun, challaging game for all ages :) :) :)
I like this game very much. It takes away the time when you are bored. It also makes me hungry xD 5 Stars great game!
Every day are thinking how to get the gem , but it's so hard! I spend 20000coin in the casino but not even 1 gem! It really makes me upset!
Very addictive
Only gave you 1 star as you can't continue with any upgrades unless you have a really stupid amount of gems!! Fix the gem problem and this game would be great but at the moment it's just frustrating!!!
Loved this game until the last update. Nearly impossible to win gems at the casino now. A real shame as the game is great but is frustrating if you aren't prepared to pay for items. Originally I would have rated this game 5 star - please make it easier to get gems!
Super addictive.
Hey<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0083> I'm loving this brilliant game! I swear. It's absolutely amazing<f0><U+009F><U+0090><U+00B8> so pls keep updating it to make it even better! I was absolutely addicted. But there is just a tiny problem.... It says tap on a thing to receive free coins and gems but it doesn't work! And also... Pls make some things a bit cheaper.      ( AKA) the pizza cheese upgrade ! It's worth 20 diamonds. And maybe make some restaurants a bit cheaper . And also- what's with the same characters?? by anyway, IM STILL IN LOVE WITH THIS GAME! And it's so good, because it doesn't make u ZOOM into the thing- like in an ice cream game. There's a bench and all. This game is great:)<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0083> thank u<f0><U+009F><U+0092><U+008B><f0><U+009F><U+0092><U+008B><f0><U+009F><U+0092><U+008B><f0><U+009F><U+0092><U+008B>
Great game very addictive
I love this game. But earning gems is near impossible unless you level up! You can hardly buy any restaurants because you need so many gems!!!!! Please fix this! I love this game and I am sad I can hardly enjoy playing it
"Good game, addictive but watch out ... Money grabber!  You need to upgrade to pass harder level, to do this require gems and they don't come by too often - unless purchased.
Can end up paying much more than its worth."
Love this game it's awesome
Clever app which rapidly costs a fortune if you wish to continue playing. Will find another app to waste time, & save dollars.
This game WAS great, now it's so not! To many bugs not enough opportunities to get gems. I've been playing for months and have finished all levels but now to try and perfect my game is impossible. I play everyday and I keep getting day 1 or 2 coins. I haven't been able to get 2 gems since the change over and now it's so hard to win anything let alone gems in the pokie room. You should of left it the way it was cause now you have lost another good customer as I refuse to give any money to greedy game makers.
I'm addicted to this game. Loved it until you have to spend gems and it takes ages to get just 7. Then I realised HOW TO GET MORE GEMS <f0><U+009F><U+0092><U+008E><f0><U+009F><U+0092><U+008E><f0><U+009F><U+0092><U+008E> 1. Change the date on your phone to the next day 2. Open Cooking Fever and collect the welcome back reward 3. Close Cooking Fever 4. Repeat steps 1-3 until you're filthy ri¢h!! <f0><U+009F><U+0092><U+008E><f0><U+009F><U+0092><U+008E><f0><U+009F><U+0092><U+008E><f0><U+009F><U+0092><U+008E><f0><U+009F><U+0092><U+008E>
"Thought this game was fun, up until game reset itself & I lost all my levels, now have to start all over. 
Would give more stars if price of gems to upgrade within the game were not so expensive & length of time shorter to upgrade.... Takes forever to save up the $$."
No way to get gems :(
It's fun to start with but when you run out of gems you're basically replaying old levels as you can't play any other ones without gems. Very disappointed as it's a fun game but can't play it anymore as I'm not spending any money on it
Initially, I loved the game. But, like EVERYONE else who has posted, I'm frustrated by the need to get gems. It's nearly impossible! And, now it has stopped giving me 2 gems as a reward for coming back each day. Painful!!! How do you expect people to enjoy the game when they need to get 30 or more gems? Start listening to your users, please!
Sooo addictive, uses good strategy & need lots of skill
Should scrap the gems for upgrading the neccessities or at least provide an alternative to earning more gems. Ridiculous
Okay so I did really like this game and overtime I spent around $100 on gems cause I was hoping to make progress <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A9> What a waste of money!! I'm still stuck on the pizza stage and finding it impossible to play without buying more gems...yep! U people are very greedy!! Very disappointed! <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1>
I love it and it fun and relaxing and try hard to beat the timer
"I love this game buuuuut.................
How do you get the gems so easily I mean the prices for upgrades is pretty harsh they cost like 10 diamonds and a few coins      The coins are the good and the diamonds are bad there should be no diamonds at all."
Addictive and great game but don't download, unless your prepared to pay $100 on gems
This app is so awesome it's fun and it makes me hungry :)
Love the game but way too expensive to progress or upgrade and no way of earning enough diamonds to be useful
I'm addicted to this game... I've recently updated it and now when I open it to play it loads for a bit and closes and returns to my home screen <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0081><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0081> plz fix this problem <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008A>
I love this game but today when I played it no customers arrived!  So weird!  I waited about a minute and it was just blank. I can cook ep and plate up etc but no customers show up,  please fix!
Love the game. So addictive. But seriously, the gems. There's gotta be a better way to get gems. I'd pay for the game, but not for gems. Make gems easily available and I'll give the game 5 stars. Either that or scrap the gems altogether. Has to be easier ways to upgrade without using gems.
At a point where I can't progress because of lack of gems. Developers want you to shell out decent amount of cash for any gems which is a shame. Maybe add a way for your users to buy gems using the in game money?? Like 1000 coins = 1 gem or something. Thanks
"Enjoyable game, however to actually progress you need gems and it makes it virtually impossible (and really boring) to get them.

I think they try and force you to buy gems.

I don't know why the developers don't just use advertising to make money,"
Too many diamonds r needed for this game it is impossible to upgrade everything change this or I'm deleting and also my reward for playing everyday restarts every 3-4 days and not the whole seven wat r use doing
You seriously need too fix the bugs on this app, it takes about 10 minutes too load a LEVEL, even when I have 4G. It's a good game but it isn't worth sitting and waiting for it too load and sometimes crash... Please fix so I can actually enjoy it.
Used to love the game, but now getting gems has become hard and this is a game where you need gems to survive. And to top it off you don't even get much XP when you complete your task. Got boring after 4 days. Oh yea and the glitches are so annoying!
Awesome!!
This is one of the best games ever
Awesome game but glitches once addicted. Much anger now.
This could be a great game except for the upgrades, as MANY people before me have commented. When will the creators get their heads out of the ground and LISTEN! We're the ones playing your game so why do you want to frustrate your users?! I just spent $30,000 at the casino and won $1800 back but NO GEMS! There needs to be a change or this game will dwindle out of existence.
I thought this game is boring when I saw it but it turned out to be Awesome download it
"This game could be awesome, but you get two gems a day (I'm up to my 22nd day of two gems it doesn't go up) when any decent upgrades you need cost 25 that doesn't seem right. I've put money into this game but everything's so expensive it doesn't last long even using it only when I HAVE to upgrade. 
I feel ripped off!! if they could just bring down the gem cost of everything and put up the gems you can earn they would get great reviews!"
I actually like the game, it's fun and colourful, my issue is with the pricing system of upgrades. I agree with the many people before me that there really needs to be a change. There is no way to get gems except when you level up, and that's just not enough to purchase anything. There is no way I will pay real money to progress in a game. I would rather pay for the game and be able to upgrade, then spend money buying gems. Or even include them in the earnings. Gems should only be needed for really high cost things, not to simply upgrade a milkshake. It's also unfair you have to pay coins and gems. One or the other please. End of rant, but something needs to happen.
This is a really good game however I am getting put off the game due to the lack of progress because of being unable to accrue a lot of gems. Gems are hard to come buy, I'm on the second restaurant and I find it difficult to pass due to lack of gems. It's a shame as it's a really good game.
Good, addictive game BUT gems are vital and you don't get many unless you spend $$. And the gems are pretty expensive, no decent deals.
You really need to be extremely lucky to win gems in gambling or buy it with real money to proceed with the game...
Its a fantastic game, I recommend it!
Awesome!!!!
Fantastic game I love it so I'm rating it 5 star don't forget to sing this in the tune of I don't care I love it
Funny, the last time I read these reviews there were a lot of very unfavourable comments , they seem to have disappeared ....... Wonder where they went ???? I love the graphics and the concept of this game but I can't believe how expensive it is to make any progress! I am quite happy to part with a few dollars here and there to speed a game up but I refuse to put one cent into this money grabbing game. How cheeky you guys are !!!!! Anyway , I'll go back to playing Township and occasionally throw the odd dollar or two into it when I become impatient. Your very greedy , what a shame.
Very addictive game but very frustrating at the same time. I am now on the Seafood/Chinese restaurant and the only way to upgrade anything is with gems which I don't have!! It takes forever to level up in XP, and when you do you only receive 6 gems. Love the game but won't keep playing if I need to use real money to buy gems. I think you should consider having gems as a reward as well as the coins.
Just did the latest update and now there are glitches. I'm the pizza one level 27 and when I go to give a apple cake the game cuts out and it goes to home screen or just randomly goes to home screen when playing.  Is anyone else having problems??
Good the game but the wedding dresses are too expensive and the one you buy with cash is really tacky for us girls who might not like that sort of thing, can you please give us a better option for wedding dresses you can buy in cash and at least make it a little bit cheaper?! Also I think you should be able to see your husbands house and move in and I also think it would be so cool if you could actually have kids! I think you should be able to actually talk to people as well it would make the game even better! I hope you actually read all of our helpful ideas and take them into account on trying to improve your game!
"I think you should be able to do your own tweets and stuff and like reply to your enemy or say something stuff about other people when they say stuff about you 
I have seen this same complaint many times on reviews but you seem to ignore it I'm sure we would all be quite pleased to see this in the update coming up.
Other than that VERY VERY VERY addictive"
Perfect and fun, just like me
This game is amazing I absolutely love it I love the new updates but I wish you would have children! It's so addictive though :)
Soo good
Every time I click anywhere within the Florence wedding location, it only will select the block of flowers decoration even if I'm clicking on the groom! Very frustrating!
Ok
Love it!!
Love love
It's an addictive game but it does occasionally gets boring after a while like no drama and can u make earning stars a little easier please
I love this game so much, but I'm trying to do this mission where just before you get married you have go on three five-star dates to prove they aren't cheating, but when I go to go on the date my partners name doesn't appear which means I'm going to fail the mission which is unfair because I can't do anything about it :(
Love it :)
"I love this game **PERIOD**
Suggestions to improve
1. Easier ways to gain energy - eg working at kardash receiving energy rather than money
2. Have babies and more hairstyles that can be payed with money rather than stars
3. Clothing to be less pricey 
4. Having conversations (talking back) replying to tweets and even making our own tweet/status update
4. Mini games added - eg . Close up of character and do her makeup (give a brief), match the shoes, outfits"
I love it
This game is addictive as
"This game is really fun! You get to dress up, do photo-shoots, go on dates, get married and heaps of other things. I love playing this game in my spare time or when I get bored so if you do t have this game I recommend u get it. It's a great app.

Shania! xx"
I want to be able to dress the person in dating it's saying it's locked.
Addictive
"When I went to a party Chad and Crystal were there and we got in a fight. I lost fan because of Chad, Crystal and of course Willow make us have a go and we make a tweet. I also want babies in the game after you get married at least one baby.

Still love the game but need lots of stars - Grace"
This game is awesome but the hair is a little expensive
I love this game so much! But for some reason in my game my relationship with my boyfriend doesn't reach more the 499. This kinda annoys me because I can't get a max relationship. Other than that is is the best game and I am actually addicted!!
Really enjoy playing this game am definitely addicted. I would love if there was a seperate section for the clothing you have won or bought. Find it annoying that I have to scroll right thorough to look for my clothing.
I really like this game! I like it how you can pick what to say which effects on how people like you and effects whether you go up or down on the rating list.
Love this game so addictive lol!!!
Why do I keep losing fans after 5 star appearances?
Love it so much
Very entertaining
My friends recommend it to me and I love it!!
It is the best game ever! It is great to pass time!
Amazing
So good
Honestly needs more wedding hairstyles and the cost of energy is outrageously expensive please lower it <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0082> and too many jobs at the same time like no chill fr. Other than that amazing app.
Great game, love it!
Addicted to the game me and my boyfriend play it together and we are getting married in the game haha
Please add kids in it. Please let people in the game have children!!!!!!!!! Thanks for adding marriage!!!! :)
This game is the best game ever and enjoy playing it !!
<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+009B> love it DOWNLOAD IT ITS AAMAZINNGZ
love it
I'm in love with tis game it's so addictive I spend most of my time on here I only got the game and I'm in love
The game is great but their are a few flaws I would like to make known; firstly, I would like the ability to change my players name. Second, we need more ways to get those weird star/coin things, I have very little and need to buy certan objects. Three, I would appreciate more options when choosing a wedding dress and hairstyle. Last, I find that most of the pricing you put on your objects are outrageously expensive, though I understand they are very good, the aim is for us to buy them, not look at the pricetag and run away. But those are my only issues, I apologize if I come across as rude or judge mental but I REALY like this game and want it to be great for all who play it. Thank you
"Hi I Love the game and all but I find it really unfair that if you don't play the game for a few days (like say you run out of Internet), you come back and your girlfriend breaks up with you???
Then the only way to get back with them is with 40 stars which is hard when you only have like 9 it's really annoying and needs to be fixed..."
This game is soooo amazing! I am a massive fan of the Kardashian sisters! <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0083>
Love the game I totally recommend it!!
I am literally in love. And so very obsessed. Worth the download.
Love this game so much!!
This game is so addictive  and fun to play! I love it!
"I have to say that the only affordable dress is hideous. 
The others are gorgeous but cost stars. If this is some stunt to get money then I'm deleting the app."
This is one of the best games I have played in a long time. There is always something to do. U unlock clothes and shoe as u go along. I love this game!!!!
I stayed up till 5 am playing..
Its fun and entertaining yet mind tactics are needed!
loving this game!
I really like this game
"This game is just great I can't say anything bad about it. But I've noticed that you now rarely even get called by Kim, even though the whole games about her so I'd like to see more of Kim. But other than that the games great 
<U+2B50><U+FE0F><U+2B50><U+FE0F><U+2B50><U+FE0F><U+2B50><U+FE0F><U+2B50><U+FE0F> 5stars"
"So much fun but addictive haha! 
A whole new world created for you as a celebrity with Kim Kardashian as ur bff."
brilliant
Such a fun game to play. Do recommend
Download
"1) now that we can get married we should be able to have kids.
2) when we do photo shoots, we should be made to get dressed in the clothes that we're modelling.
This game is so addictive and I'm glued to it. Please consider these ideas:)!<f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008C>"
I love this game a lot, it's also very addictive and I like that. One thing I wish it had more of is the energy, I hope one day it could be easier to get more energy on the game because it takes to long. Maybe 2 mins for 1 energy instead of 5 mins for 1 energy. When you also go to model shoots I wish you could actually see some photos of your shoot & see what the media says about the clothing. It would also be pretty cool if you can type your own online posts on the game and see how the media reacts.Overall the game is amazing!
It is an awesome game to play
Loving the game so far! In the next update can we please be able to delete people from our contact list? (A-Listers dont wanna waste time on the E-Lists <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00B9>)
Love it but wish everything was less expensive
Can't get off this game but definitely needs some improvements. If we get married the next update should be that we are allowed to have kids. We also should be able to write our own tweets, why should Willow get away with saying rude things to us when we can say something witty back.
I am so inlove and addicted to this game. It's by far my favourite iphone game which surprised me because... Well I won't be mean. But anyway, one thing I wish you could change was that you could delete phone contacts because I have SOOO many and it's so hard to find the person I'm actually looking for! Please let me be able to delete them!!!
Looove it!
I love this game. It is annoying tho how long it takes to gain enough energy to complete an 6-8 hour task. And there should be more high end clothing available that doesn't cost stars but overall I am addicted and love it !
This is a awesome game, but they should be able to have kids. That's all for me!
Favourite game ever
such a fun and addicting game. could play it for days on end!
Am actually really enjoying the game play...
Thanks Kim . Brilliant idea<f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008C>
Wish the characters were a little more animated and did the actions they say they're doing lol! Other than that great game, very addictive!
It's a good game that's for sure but when I started it it didn't give me an option to put in a name and now I have no name. Need an option to change names.
Great game, fun and easy to play.
Makes the male characters look like a DB! The NPC characters have proper lengths pants? Bit ironic considering this is based on 'Fashion' and wats 'in'. Other than that, alls well!
Would recommend
"This game is fun but energy needs to refill faster especially when you have to
Complete 8 hour task and keep up dating the one guy or they dump you. Also you lose way to many fans if you don't fully complete a task but you've gotten 3 star. Overall a fun game but not very fair to players"
"Absolutely addicted!
You won't regret getting it!"
I need more fans... It doesnt have enough to earn
"I love the game so far keep doing updates and I will keep playing

Thx for the game :)"
Great! Should definitely have more quests :)
This game is so addictive, love it!
I love this game. It's so fun
I like the game but find it very expensive to play. It can take up to 3 recharges of energy to complete some assignments and then 1 recharge for others. Takes a long time to recharge. Not much to do while you wait :(
I love this game! So addicting but the only thing I would change is that I hate it when you have to wait for tasks to be completed. Like the photo shoots take 2 hours and a date takes another hour.
But like others have said everything cost to much and we should be able to buy a cheap wedding dress and have kids and every time you go on a date you get criticised by them
I love this game! I'm addicted to it but one problem...I hate the ads :( when I'm playing I always accidentally click on them.
I think we all know how fabulous this game is (<U+2B06><U+FE0F><U+2B07><U+FE0F>) but there should be a family thing with your game center friends cus my brother keeps flirting with me <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0082>
This game is so entertaining and a great time filler when your bored!!
"Love this game just so annoying having to wait for energy 
But I'm hooked"
Addictive!
I love this game, it's amazing <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0084><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0084><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0084>
Luv it
It's sometimes doesn't load properly but it good game when it does
I am obsess with this game and I've been in top 1 since! Since they release the facebook "I mean you can actually play it in facebook" no matter how I tried and getting all my task done I'm still loosing my fans. Then I tried playing it through Facebook and i have to start from scratch. It should be automatic the same character when you sign up through your phone and use the your Facebook. Now I loose my interest playing it because I just keep loosing my fans.
"Cool + great = gruel

It's a awesome game"
"It's a great game, but could have some more improvements.
Being able to have kids, being able to reply back to tweets from other stars as they make us loose heaps of fans, more interactions with partners in there home would make it great.
Also having more wedding dresses to chose from, especially cheaper ones! As it's gonna take just me alone ages to save for it cause I'm still saving for a $6,000 house, and every time I get near it I need I buy more clothes to boost my star and heart numbers. 
Otherwise, fantastic game!"
I love this game and all but I think the adds are a bit excessive. Just saying but nah I rate this a 10/10 game
I like this game but they should make it easier to get more stars
I really love this game because it fun and you can get married I would love if you were able to have kids so please make an update so you can have kids<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0098><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0098><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0084><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0084><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0084>
"The best game I ever played
Very addictive I will recommend it to anyone."
I absolutely love this game. It is so fun to play. I'm now A list and in number 1 spot. I think it's unfair that Willow Pape gains fans as you gain fans. I hope in the next update you can have kids. I also think that all of the clothes, cars, houses and food is expensive and that you can't earn stars easily. If you fixed these things I would give it 5 stars but I'm only going to give it 4.
I love this game so much, but I find it really unfair, Because whenever I try and play it stops and shuts itself down. Also I think maybe if the app gave us a 5 minute warning before
So fun haha
"This game USED to be my most favourite game of all time until...
1) I got WAY too many jobs at once and
2) I had no energy whatsoever to complete them in time while I
3) had to date because the game MADE me date some person I just happened to add in my contacts in early gaming while
4) I kept losing fans because I didn't do my jobs well because I had no energy because they make you wait FIVE MINUTES to get ONE ENERGY! 
5) Other  virtual people just keep getting fans while I go from #1 on the A-List to #20!
6) You people are making me go down spots even when I gained fans!
Fix these issues, or I WILL delete this stupid game! 
I now HATE this game, do not get it: Kim Kardashian isn't even featured in the game!"
Don't get me wrong, I love this game, but there's a whole bunch of things I think should be added. For example, I think it'd be a pretty cool idea to have kids in the game since we can now get married, it'd be a perfect addition to make a family as you can do photo shoots and stuff with your husband and your kid. Also, the game needs more quests to complete, once you do them, simon barely ever rings and there's nothing new to do within the game. I definitely think there should be more to do.
This is a very good game
I love the new marriage but I honestly reckon that we should be able to have a baby and talk to our husband whenever we want to. But mainly being able to have a FAMILY !!!!!!!!!!!
I absolutely love the game and it's addicting but I think it would be so much better with a few touches such as being able to respond to your feed updates, being able to talk to your boyfriend at his house or in general and being able to actually have a conversation while in the game with your friends who also play the game. I just think it could have a few more personal touches so you're not just constantly tapping the screen like you do on every mission. It would be awesome to have conversations with people while you're at a club completing a mission or having a party instead of tapping "small talk" something just like "how's your day" or "do you need a refill". Don't get me wrong I absolutely love the game but I think it would make a huge difference. You should be allowed to just call people on your friends list for conversations or to hang out.
It's all great
It takes forever to do anything for free but it's still fun
finally realised how terrible this game is.
When I entered the game it went in to "half screen mode" where the game only covered half of the screen.
Kim Kardashian is such a silly, time wasting game but it's funny so I play! Haha I love it x
It is an amazing game! But the only thing you have to add is the ability to change you name like only my first name is there I want to add my surname please.
I love this game, I started playing it since day one and I'm literally addicted. The only thing that is kindof annoying is how you have to use wifi to get onto the game. I'm going to be moving soon into a brand new house and won't be able to get wifi for a while. I think that this game should not have the need to have wifi just to access the game. That's all. Overall I love the game. But yeah hopefully you can change that. Much love xx
"I <f0><U+009F><U+0092><U+0097> this game it's just that I had over $14,000 and then I updated my iPod and I came back with zilch nada I was just so annoyed it took me a few hours to get Enough $ to travel so I could do a gig. <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A5> . But other than that it's a great game.<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008A>.

Renée"
"I love this game but I hate how you have to buy stars. 
Not a big fan on doing 8hour quests. Also not a big fan of having to use starts to charm people and get to know others. Surely won't be playing this for much longer"
I absolutely love this game! But in the next update i think as many people have said we should be able to have children in it. One thing I don't like is that everything is so exspensive I can't even buy my wedding dress which is over $9,000 for an okay one and 120 stars for a really nice one! Which I will have to save up a lot of money for and will take me ages to eventually get married! Cars could be a little cheaper and I think we should somehow be able to get Stars more often. I really like the game but it needs to be a bit more improved and thought through.
LOVE THIS GAME!!!!!!!! but The Kstars are wayy to hard to get!! And you need them to buy the cool items in your wardrobe! It is really annoying! I wish i could also hit back rivals on twitter!! So unfair that i cant! Other then this amazing game I'm so addicted
"ok so im addicted to this game and i check the game every two minutes for new energy and im like sleep deprived bc of it. if i could change something it would be making the clothes less expensive. also id like the stars to be easier to earn.

add my gamecenter so we can be friends on the kim k game! user: abbuscus"
<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008D><U+2728><U+2728>
I love this game its great and fun i rate it 4 stars. the clothing is a bit ghastly but some of its nice. But what i don't understand is that if your on a date is the other avatar being controlled by another person. Or they avatars that just are controlled by the makers of the game.
"This game can be played by boys or girls
The best game ever! Download it, you won't regret it!"
I love this game, it's so addictive! The best game so far but there's a major issue... For the past two days I haven't been able to go on it! I would tap on the game and it would have the symbol it always has then go to a black screen then shut off! Please fix otherwise I might delete this game<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+009E> other than that this games is the best!
I think you should make more opportunities to get the star coins also boyfriends are too needy but other than this its a good game
I love this game I am obsessed but we need more frequent quests and we need to be able to like have a chance to come back on twitter on the game without twitter and kids would be nice and it be cool if the guys were less obnoxious and be more like gentlemen
Be able to have kids and start a family and be able to do quests with your best friend!
This game is amazing and everything just one more thing. Babies would be great. It be fun having to look after the baby and also doing work. Then the baby would grow up and we be able to design it and take the kids to school. I think this is a good idea because Kim and Kanye had a baby so it fits perfectly!
"I'm just wanting to know how do you get married? What do you have to do? 
I've been playing this game since the day it first came out, I'm in love with it. I've got two of them a girl and a boy on two different Apple Products ( iPad/iPhone) and I'm in love with the game.

And can in the next update you make it that we can have a baby? 

But over all love this game!"
I think we should be able to talk on the media too because all the other celebrity's get to and some make us lose fans so we should get to talk in the media too and it should get noticed and make them lose fans if it is something bad and you should be able to have kids and your kid can get bullied and you need to pick them up from school or they walk home and you are married of course but you have already added getting married update already so everything else you should add
I love it :)
I love this game every day and night I play it haha I love that Kim made a update to get married but...i think she should make a update to have children I would love this game so much more <U+2764><U+FE0F><U+2764><U+FE0F><U+2764><U+FE0F>
<f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008D><f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008D>
This game is great but it should be able to run without wifi. It bothers me because I have an iPod and I can't do 8 hour challenges unless I'm at home for 8 hours because my iPod needs wifi. This should be in the next update.
Fun in small doses. Fills the time
Very addictive game but dislike my date commenting on my dress sense
"Wicked
So 10/10!!!"
Way too stressful for something that should be fun D:
"This is a really good game but there is one thing that you need to do is make the 8hour quests when you use what your stars that it only does I little put like I had 22 stars to use up and it only did 1star BuT I LOVE how you added the bonus star I think that's a really good idea! After all I give it 
                     * * * * * stars!"
We can have the best wedding ever
It's great but we should be able to have kids xx
this is the best game EVER. if it was up to me I would have it number one
"This game keeps crashing and whenever I finish doing one of the get free stars activities it always restarts and I don't get any 
Ps plz shorten the time to get energy because I keep losing fans and jobs"
"The reason I said it was annoying was because like every 40 seconds there is an ad. So that's why it's annoying. I love the game it's really fun but you should be able to message people and stuff. Say if there is a boy and ur dating him. If u want to get married how will he know?
So I say ur do message on this app
I love the game still"
I love this game
OMG I'm not a game kinda person but this game I just can't get enough of, I never understood my brothers and their love for their games until I downloaded this one, it's fricken hillarious & entertaining at the same time, warning though, it's quite addicting but it's good fun, can you please allow us to do more then just stand around in our boyfriend's apartment? And also, can you give us an option to punch Willow Pape in the face? Lol
I am addicted!! Maybe lower the price of the wedding and/or create more money making things. The shifts at soChic barely give you any money to pay for anything!!! ALSO my relationship is stuck at 499/500.. I have gone on about 6-7 dates to get it past 500 and gifted her a 35 k point dress, but it is still 499!!! Do I need to complete the wedding to make it go higher or something?!?!? Please fix!!!
I love this game but it's too hard to get stars. Even viewing more offers doesn't work because you can't scroll down to download the other games to gain stars.
Great game awesome features but how do you get cars put in a new update about a car dealer
It's so addictive but the energy takes way to long to load
Sweeeet
Great game
literally i swear to god if I keep losing fans because of willow i will delete this game with no hesitation
Energy takes forever to regenerate kinda not liking this game anymore
energy takin' 4 ever 2 load, failin half my time limited quests bc no energy godzilla damn i spent SIX kim coins on FIVE energy like damn thats not ok w me

"I love this game so much I constantly play but there's 3 problems for me
1. I'm 2nd on the list but I just can't get to 1st cause Willow Pape is always 20million more fans than me no matter how many I gain
2. Energy doesn't refill fast enough I play a lot and having to wait for at least and hour to play again is annoying especially if you're almost at 5stars and your energy needs to refill and the time is almost running out 
3. I'm level 23 and there's not many clothes left to get so can you please add
More clothes"
I love this game! So addicted i play every day but im dating dirk and he gave me the key to his place and ived reach the max of dating he wont propse :( do i have to resart with another person plz i want to stay with dirk diamond but nvm that AWESOME GAME LOVE IT!
It's such a fun game ahhhhhhhhh
I love this game I am 110% addicted but as I'm on level25 there isn't that many new clothes to aim for in the other levels so please release a whole heap more for past levels and 25+ levels. Thank you so much
Totally love this game kim kardashian oldayyy
yay
I enjoy It a lot but I don't like how you have to wait so long for the energy. If fixed ill rate higher
It keeps saying that It has no connection but my wifi is working fine!! Only got on twice and love the game though
Very good game only problem is that energy doesn't regenerate fast enough
I love this app but the latest update is crashing everytime while on the loading screen. So frustrating! It really is a great app!
Eh, I love the game but why is energy so difficult to get? Makes me not want to play
Awesome game!
Love the game when I can get into it. Always says can't connect to network even though I'm connected. Have to push try again constantly and takes at least 5 mins just to get into the game. Other than that great game
One of my favourite apps but there is an issue that when I do well and get a good rating it glitches and I lose fans even though it was definitely meant to be a plus (I got over 3 stars). Pleas fix this bug, I keep loosing fans!
Good game but every time I go into the chest and click the trousers button it just send me to the phone homepage so that means I can't change my trousers please fix it!!
Please please please fix this problem!! I downloaded this game and whenever I go to play it, it says "Please check your internet, try again" But I have Internet! :( Really wanted to play this game. Please improve it
It's a fun game! But super annoying you have to pay for things so you can not be so "tired"
"Annoyed! First downloaded this on my phone Samsung s3 said I didn't have any internet connection so I downloaded app into iPad mini was working great, was just on it 10 mins ago and then all of a sudden says there is no internet connection! Very confused sad and annoyed I really do enjoy this game so please fix this immediately please!!! <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A2><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A3><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00B4><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0095>
Still hasn't been fixed??? NEED TO FIX THE INTERNET PROBLEM ASAP PLEASEEEE."
"The game is great but it only works sometimes it always says cannot connect to try again but it just does it again.
Plz fix"
Love this game but would be great to buy hair with money and also dating time should be expanded before they call to break up. I don't always get to see them
Love this game am addicted to it thank you so much hope the Kardashians family get to join this game as well and can do challenges with them :)
Me and my cousins wifi system doesn't let me play the game it comes up with a notification saying cannot connect try again but I can play at my friends house and my school so please could you fix this cause loving this game
Great
Updated app thinking all bugs would be fixed eg Internet connection . Very disappointed as I adore this game even though it is very hard to play most of the time because of the Internet connect failure <f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008E><f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008E>
Good game, but it won't load on my device anymore. It gets to the loading screen and then crashes!! No Halloween costume for me! <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0094>
Loving this game however agree with others, it takes too long for energy to refill so becomes difficult to get 5 stars therefore be able to win extra stuff.
"energy needs to recharge faster - sometimes doesn't recharge fast enough to be able to get 5 stars on a job. 
I think a map would also be handy - there are so many places and they don't always remind you which city they are in. 
The K stars need to be easier to obtain since so much of the clothing and objects are bought with them."
:)
Love this game but i cant open any daily halloween giftboxes because it only gives me the option to open one if i pay 40 Kstars.. Help!! :(
Please fix the problem of the "internet connection" , it's a very good game although I cannot get into it half the time because it says there's no Internet connected , when well obviously there is , the more it does it the less I want to play it ! So commm on <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A5>
Very cool game but needs more updates also one for the Internet problem thanks so much
I love this game
"A really cool addictive game. 
Hard to collect energy though and there also needs to be more ways of collecting energy. Hard to collect k stars although do like how you can watch a quick video to collect stars. Would be cool to expand and build your business (I.e. Opening more so chic shops in other cities). Would also be cool to see characters like Khloe and kourtney in the game. Thanks for the cool game!!!!"
Since I updated the game it keeps crashing!!!
Um, I don't really like how much some dates cost, I've seriously run out of money because of it, I'm down to like $25
I love this game but in the Halloween update I can't buy So Chic?
Awesome game kinda addictive
I like it
The game is a 5 star <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0098><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0098><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0098> I love it
New changes are awesome!! Thank You
Great game. Wish I could get more silver stars though
Only issue is that it takes so long for your energy to go back up (hence the four stars & title of review) Apart from that, very cool game.
Quite interesting so far but not sure how long it will lasts
<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008A>
I can't gain anymore fans, when I have an event and I get the feedback it doesn't come up with the fans that you would normally gain
For some reason when I get 5 stars on an event, instead of gaining fans I'm losing them? So angry as I used to be #1 A-list and am now #7. Please fix this I'm so upset
, Looooooving this game <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0098>
I love this game but I think a few things need to be addressed. I would give this a five star rating if it worked with out Internet or at least worked on more than one connection I love playing this but I hate how it only works on one connection if you could make it that it works on all connections or even doesn't need Internet than it would have five stars all the way
100% love this game, so addictive and fun, BUT it is constantly saying I have no internet connection when I do. So I always get low stars not because I'm not doing it but vecauce I cannot login which is so annoying. Also when having events I'd personally love it for the game to tell you what town it is in because I still have no idea where muse is and am constantly going to every town/city to find it. Overall I love this game so much, I literally play it every day !!!!
Please work on syncing Facebook version with app. Have had this app for three weeks now and I have just started to play it via desktop I'm not happy that my phone app and fb versions won't sync therefore I am constantly having to log in to my desktop Facebook to play it.
...the internet thing? Could be an awesome game if you didn't need the internet to load and play the game!
This game won't work connected to Internet but works fine with cell data however I don't want to waste my data. This needs to be looked into and fixed. Also, there needs to be more wedding dress options and some cheaper styles maybe $2000.
KK love
I don't know whether it's just my phone or not. But I haven't got any new goals got weeks. This game is starting to get pointless and boring now. Use to be fun.
I love this game I just hate the fact that you have to have wifi. So I always end up using my 4G when I'm not at home! And I also hate how I always finish my energy real quick
I have enjoyed playing this game. Would love it to involve more interaction than just tap buttons and using energy eg perhaps mini games to obtain stuff. I have also had it glitch recently as others stated with it claiming internet connection problems when there have been none.
Would like to be able to go through jobs quicker and not have Simon ringing with jobs all the time and allowing more time for parties and dates
It's an alright kinda game but yeah it's a fine game :)
It doesnt need to your girlfriend/boyfriend we're througor like that then you will be single every minute<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00AD>
"I'm not sure if this is just happening to me but, 
I'm not getting any phone calls from Simon or Maria which mean I'm not getting anymore work like parties and appearances. This is really annoying me because it making me lose fans and making me lose interest in the game. I don't enjoy it as much as I did from when I first got it."
I played it once and it worked fine, I liked the game, but the next time I tried to open the app, it told me I needed to connect to the Internet, even though I was already connected!! Please fix!!
This game is cool but it takes for ever to load and its very glitchy
THIS GAME IS THE BEST!!! I absolutely love this game sooo much!! Its taken over my life! MUST DOWNLOAD x!
such a good game!
I enjoy this game. It's as demanding and time consuming as I allow it to be. Definitely worth the download :)
It takes so long to energise. And you don't earn money fast enough. I spend so much time on this (when I'm free) at least give me props for time instead of wanting me to buy money all the time. Otherwise awesome :).
Great game but I take for ever to star up
It's a great game but it won't connect to my wifi and it's full bar. Fix it por favor
OMG SORT OUT THE 'CAN NOT CONNECT TO THE INTERNET' PROBLEM. IT IS DRIVING ME AND MY FRIENDS CRAZY!!!!!
I love the game, well done! But almost every time I try to open the game it says that it can't connect to the network even though the wifi is perfectly fine. If I'm lucky I can ever get into it. Also I would like if it were easier to get K stars and if energy recharged faster! Once I've completed one date or photoshoot I can't complete another forever and then when the energy has recharged I try to go back into the game and it doesn't connect again!
I honestly think this is a great game!!! But I agree that they should be able to have s** and have babies after the marriage :) I actually love this game though it's amazing
<U+2764><U+FE0F>
Annoying when money falls on floor instead of automatically being given
I love this game but there seems to be a problem with it as, my character is suck inside so chic and I can't exit or do anything in there? Could you please do something thank you
Keeps taking forever to load and says no internet connection which is bull
I honestly love this game its the best i can't stop playing it. Could the game please play without internet and the clothes alot cheaper because it takes me ages to save also could they have babies please.
It's alright when it works!!!!! It keeps saying no connection<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00AD><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00AD><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00AD>
Says I'm not connected to the Internet when I am.
Your game is awesome
This game is very addictive!
Love it
Really fun. U will like a lot do get
Please add more levels, quests with willow and more from Simon and Maria and also please more fans and levels and more clothing, I am so obsessed with this game and I don't want to have to stop playing it
there's still an issue with sometimes the game refusing to connect to the internet. Heaps of people obvious have this problem and it needs to be fixed.
Its alright , not bad. Sometimes boring <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0082> and stuff are too expensive and the energy is gaay! Lol . But all around its an alright game. Not bad Kim Kardashion Laho <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0082>
I love this game so much!! I'm level 24 and I need a new storyline. Please update new quests please
Yolo!
Love this app!!!! So addictive and fun. My fav thing to do - add New Zealand here please :) xKimsBiggestFan
This game is super fun i give it a 4 star but for some reason i cant take off the sunglasses on one of the people on my contacts and its really annoying. And also it might be helpful if there was a " are you sure? " thing after you click break up with someone because i accidentally clicked and now im saving up for 6 stars to get back with the person. And also it would be nice if you diddnt need wifi for the game because it honestly doesnt really need wifi apart from the Game Center and Facebook connections.
Wont load! Happens heaps. Locked out again.
My Review 5Star!Game<U+2B50><U+FE0F>
"I find this game awesome but things you could improve is...
1) When you are out of energy, you can go to a pub or something and get a drink or food to quicken the recharging.
2) You can have babies!!! Heaps of celebrities are famous for their children and it could be really good for improving your dating or marriage.
3) You can walk your pets so to improve your rating as in magazines heaps of celebrities are improving their popularity because of their pets.
Apart from these, it's a very good and addicting game.
PS - Just saying, it's weird for me because I'm dating my sister on it!"
"Every time I open app it says it can't connect to Internet and yet all my other apps can!
Please fix!"
I like this but get frustrated when the goal doesn't tell me what city the appearance is in. Sometimes i have to travel to all the cities before i find the place i'm meant to go. Please fix
When it works it's great but please fix the bugs I haven't been able to play in weeks now
I went on to the game and told me it couldn't connect to the network I've redownloaded it 5 times same thing comes up really annoyed<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A0><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A4>
I first downloaded it and it didn't work with wifi but after a few updates it got better and is now a really great game.
Awesome
"I love this game!
I think it would be really cool if at the end of a photo shoot you got to see all the photos, it would just make it a little more authentic, because if you got a low rating your photos could be worse and if you got a high rating they could be amazing!"
Keep getting internet connection error, so annoying, can't play the game.  Close to deleting it.  Please fix!!!!!
Can you please fix this error!! "We can't connect to the network. Please check your network connection and try again."using and iPhone 6 with iOS 8.0.2
IT HAS BEEN SAYING IT CAN NOT REACH NETWORK PLEASE FIX IT <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1> I WAS JUST PLAYING ON IT, NOW THIS. WHAT A DISGRACE.
My life is complete because of this game #feelingblessed
The game is alright when I can get it to load ! Keeps saying no internet connection when there is. Pretty frustrating.
So it works perfectly fine the first day and then it says I can't connect whereas te wifi here is real strong! I really wanna play :( fix it pleeease. Also I hate how everything is soooo expensive, and I dislike waiting ages for energies.
So good I really enjoy this game!
But some of the things use up a little to much energy, and it isnt fun waiting around also, the K (sliver coins) could you make those easier to earn? Because charming people and buying clothes is quiet expensive
"I downloaded this game a while ago and it worked alright the first week. I went to go on as I normally would and it told me I had no internet connection so I checked my internet and it said it was working fine. I then went on other apps that require internet and they were working fine too. 
I tried various locations that have Internet to see if the game was working and still nothing.
I then tried my last option, which was to delete the game off my iPhone and try download it onto my iPod. It then said no Internet connection still. So I tried it on Facebook off my laptop, its has taken so far half an hour and it is still loading as I write. 
Please try fix this issue as I am not the only one going through this problem! And I'm sure many other people would enjoy playing it if they actually could."
It keeps saying can't connect please try again!!!
I love this game it's so fun and really enjoyable to play! Some things I think you should add thou is that u should add getting dirty with people and showing it on the screen! Also people should have babies on here! Another thing u could add is when u have nothing to do while u are waiting for the next thing to come up somebody should call u to meet up or go on a date ! This game is really good but with these improvements it will make it even better!
OMG ! I love your game tbh , the drama you have and the amends you make and the differences between famous and nobody . All the different workers and experiences also the stunning clothes are fab ! Only thing is that I try to save my Kim stars , but most job interviews and chat include them :( I would so love to see New Zealand in the travel airport . Wonder what it will be like if we had children on the game lol :D
I love this game so much! It's a great but very addictive game!<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00B3>
Can you make it possible to change your bf/gf clothing, like remove their stupid sunglasses and make some clothing cheaper. I find it impossible to save up to buy a car cuz I have to buy new clothing all the time to get a bonus start. Also the energy takes way to long to refill, it honestly makes it impossible to get a five star rating for some events and I always loose fans becuz of it. But otherwise it's a great game and very addictive :)
"When it's loading it says can't connect try again and I press it and it comes back up again 

FIX THIS PROBLEM"
It's fun to play especially when you just need something to do to unwind from the day
I love love love this game it's like taken over my life !!! Lol it's amazing and awesomely addictive <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A5>
So fun and glamorous
I'm really disappointed because it can't connect to the internet. I sure I would like it if I could connect <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+009E><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+009E><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+009E><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A2><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A2><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A2>
Although the game is super fun and I really enjoy it, there isn't much of a selection when it comes to locations! I would really like to see Tokyo added into the game as their are no Asian type countries! I also think there should be more of a selection of shoes rather than just heels. :)
But whenever I click on the game it says try to reconnect like everytime I click on the game :( i was wondering when are you gonna fix that problem thanks, btw congrats on knorth west
Omg!! I love this game!!! I love how you get to hang out with Kim Kardashian!!! And how you can gets jobs, make friends, adopt pets, buy different houses and sooooo much more!!! I think that this is a great way to get your future started- yes, its a game, but its fun snd relates to reality!!! Love it!!
Good game but keeps saying can't connect check your internet connection, but my other games that require Internet work fine....
This game is great, I love playing it! But when I open the app, it doesn't work and says it 'can't connect, try again' but every time I do, it still doesn't let me play! I haven't  been on it for ages now! x
Very addictive app!
I updated the game and it completely restarted and I was an a-list, I am extremely disappointed with the update it sounded pretty cool what a shame I lost it all, can't be bothered working back up again .
#myfav
Still not connecting well. After all the money earned for this that you got from kids you really can't fix a connection error?
This game is really fun now it's had the update and it was really cool when Kim Kardashian herself sent us a video message.The ONLY thing I find is a bit annoying is it is really hard to get K stars and you have to pay a lot of money to get them so I think you should get 10+ K stars on photo shoots depending on how good you did the photoshoot...
Love this game and the updates are so awesome too!
I think this a great game....... Once you could play it! I'm not sure if this is with other people but I feel that it wont let me play because of the internet. If they improve that then the game would be 5 stars but at the moment it's 3 I haven't been able to play it for ages
Hi,this game is honestly the best of the best. It is extremely fun and exciting. I love the idea of weddings and video calls,but I think that changing your name and age would be a great name as well. You could also create your own cell phone number and address? This would be really cool for the contacts section. Thanks for creating an awesome game! -Mia Wild NewZealand
We'll I carnt even play, it just continues to tell me my connection failed. And I'm on wifi so.... Lol
Only annoying thing is the energy
Keeps telling me to check my network connection even though I am connected to the Internet and have even turned off my internet modem and turned it back on again. Please fix.
Would like this game if I actually could play it. Every time I try to connect it says it cannot connect to the server and to check my wifi connection. It does work over 4g but it uses too much data. Please fix this.....
Awesome game!! Addicted!!
Fantastic game yet have to have very strong internet to connect and even then sometimes it doesn't work. But such fun except when your date is forever rude about my outfit
Love this game, but the energy takes way too long and the whole wifi connection thing. I would rate if five other than these two problems. Great game overall! I really recommend! <f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008D><f0><U+009F><U+008C><U+009F>
I love this game I have it on my iPod. But, I can't get it on my iPad?? This is really annoying because I am addicted!! Please help me!! Otherwise I love this game and recommend it for 11-20 or so...
So very addictive, love it!!
Such a good game, addicted within days. Spent $150 on it already, #oops!
I can only get into the game twice out of 20 tries, it says that I'm not connected to the wifi but I clearly am, it shows that I am, other wifi required games work, social apps work. FIX THIS PLEASE. After fixing I will rate a 5 star
Too addictive.
it tell my to check internet connect every time when i play. it donesnt work at all!
What sort of outfit do you wear to impress your date ?
Love this game, it's really cool except energy takes too long and 8hr missions frustrate me <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A9> but other then that it's a real great game to get hang of <f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008D><f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008C> thank you
I absolutely love this game! It's so fun. I'm addicted, it's a must have. I just think a bit more energy would be better, but other than that it's awesome!
So addicted but I wish the energy wouldn't take so long to build back up. Also wish it wouldn't use so much data!!
Not interested in an update unless it consists of a Wi-Fi connection fix! Pretty sure that's all 99.99% of us want to see.. Unfair when we spend money in this game and yet to find we can't play it majority of the time... Sort it out already!!!!
Good
This games addictive lol I love it. Five stars <f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008D><f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008C>
Fix these connection issues. Its a great game when you actually get to play zzz!!
"Addicted to this game. 
I wish the energy wouldn't take so long to be restored"
I love it
Love it xx
I love this game it is really fun and I enjoy playing it <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008B><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008D>
Would be fun but it doesn't work on wifi, only on 4g, so I deleted it.
Good game!
The first time I got this game it said I had no connection when I had 3 bars. All my other games that are connected to the internet work <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00AA> plz help!!!!!
It's very fun
Would earn 5 stars if earning free stars, cash etc actually worked!
I've had this game for a while now and never has it let me CONECT! What's the point of downloading it if it never lets you past the loading part!
Not a bad game, but I just cannot stand waiting around for the energy. It's kills your fun.
Just downloaded and can't even open because it says "can't connect" waste of time!
This game is great, but it could be better if it could connect to my home wifi, it only works on my 4G and 3G and school wifi. I would like to play the game without having to waste my data.
There's a connection problem
Lol
This game was not worth the download. Every time I opened the app it would say it couldn't connect. Seems like a lot of people have had the same problem. If I left it on that screen it would finally load and then I would be able to dismiss the cannot connect notifier. Also the gigs and dates were consistently building up. Because the games has so much trouble connecting I would often not be able to finish gigs and then get bad reviews. I just ended up deleting the app, wasn't worth the constant hassle.
I never was able to connect to the game but after an update it works perfectly fine now and I love this game so much. Wish K-Stars were a little more easier to get though
It's probably one of the most addictive games out but it's great.
Really fun app just hate it how it cuts off my music
Good game
What's going with the gigs? I haven't been offered any for 3 days now? Games boring if you can't do anything....
I love it
"Kim k is an AWESOME game but the 
only reason why i gave it 4 stars is because it gets addictive. 
I recently introduced my friend to Kim K and she was stuck to her iPad from the start. 
But if your sick of boring games and are looking for one to enjoy than get Kim k."
Can't connect to the game ever. Have tried uninstalling and reinstalling multiple times and it won't let me connect. Don't waste your time downloading.
I try not to be negative but sweet baby Jesus what is up with never being able to connect to a server. Fix the glitches. I can't review the game because I've never been able to connect to actually play it.
The Game is okay, the connection and free Star system is buggered when it finally connects and i try get stars using the get free stars option i never get them after completing the required task many a times. The connection 90% of the time doesn't work even when i have strong wifi connection. Alot of bugs and the Listing system is too high to simply make A-list.
needs more gigs!
I can't even start playing this game because the connection never works even if I have really good connection.
Not particularly keen in the amount of energy it takes to complete things
<f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008D>
Its a cool game to play but could do with more energy and K stars.
So this game won't connect to my wifi and i contacted help and they weren't that helpful couldn't even give me a reason why it wouldn't connect.
Most of the time it kept saying it can't connect to network while I already have good Wifi connection and other games have no problems connecting to it!!! But it works fine on 3G network, HOWEVER, it chews a lot of data and I found out the hard way that in 2 days I used up 80% of my data allowance just from playing this game. Not worth keeping!
I open this game several times in a row up to 30 times and it won't connect only to my cellular data which I can't use to much off . This is pathetic please get this fixed I enjoy the game when it actually works
Addicting love this game but they always make you spend WAY to many starts for one gig plz change that <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008B><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+008B><f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008C>
This game is amazing I highly recommend this game , so addicting I play it 24/7 xx
Amazing!!
Been trying to Install for the past hour! Brrrrr can't remove this app either
As I love playing this game on my phone, it does not let me play when I am connected to WiFi. I have to use my mobile data (which is now gone). Please fix this issue. This game deserves 2 stars for its many errors. Thanks. <f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008E>
The  game  is fun. Just need to fix the connection problem, it's really annoying when that's happen all the time.
Can't even connect to the network to play the game! What a fail!!
I was sooo addicted on my iPod, but ever since I got it on my phone I can't connect to the network
I was able to delete and download the game and it use to work but now it won't connect to my WiFi at all. Getting annoyed
It won't at all work on my wifi. And I don't know why because it works on other wifi spots just not mine!
Awsome game
Please fix the connection issues, I started deleting then reloading app and that worked for a bit but now no longer works. Also when you are in the game it tends to freeze a lot which just adds to the connection problem as this makes the game less enjoyable. Please fix these problems as its a great game
It wouldn't connect to my wifi and I could only use my cell data (which is now gone), it takes way too long to get energy!!!!! So I've stopped playing it it's frustrating that I can't just play the game without the silly energy thing, I was really liking it so this stuff really needs fixing especially the wifi glitch.
It is the best game ever I can,t stop playing!!!!!!!!!
My wifi is perfectly fine but every time I try play it says it can't connect it's so annoying because I can't play PLEASE FIX
Besides a glitch that made me restart way into the game I like it :)
"I enjoyed the game at first but after the update I've been asked to do too many gigs and my partner keeps asking to go on dates after each date.
It's even not difficult to complete these tasks when the energy is hard to get.
Either make it easier to get more energy instead of getting it every 5 minutes or give us less gigs."
every time i try to go into the game it says theres no wifi connection which is incorrect as everything else that uses internet works
Frustrating how it always comes up 'Can't connect' and how you try to write a review but the nickname you choose is taken so the whole review disappears - sort it out please!
This would be a fab game if it would connect to the internet!! I have to delete the game, reinstall it then start again and it bugs me with these notifications then i cant connect. Please fix this. Maybe <U+2B50><U+2B50><U+2B50><U+2B50> next time.
"But I'm at max level and fans I'm #13 top couple and rising but it's starting to get boring 
Stop adding new destinations and add levels and fans heaps like over 500 million more fans take the levels to past 50 just focus on those first"
Great game! love it just wish it ddnt take ages to level up!
It takes to long to get energy and then I lose fans and its really annoying.
I can't even get onto this app cause it says I have no internet connection when i do fix it soon or I'm deleting the app
Every time I try to open this games it says I've got no wifi connection when I've got full bars this is a really big glitch and should be fixed
Big fan of Kim and this is great!!
I've heard that this game is amazing, so I downloaded it. The thing is, when I open it the game says it can't connect. I check my wifi like it says to do, and it doesn't work when I try again. I really want to play but I can't! Please fix this, because I didn't even get a chance to try it out!
Quits as soon as it opens.
Love this game!
Seems this is happening to a lot of people! Would love to play the game, but I can't connect. Needs to be sorted ASAP!!!!!!! *update* still not fixed! This is not ok!
This game does not at all live up to the hype. "Hundreds of fashion options" for a start, you don't at all, very limited in fact. Very expensive. The game play itself has a good concept, except time costing activities, which can be a real pain. And these activities are boring. This game is addicting, but it's not great. I had almost 90 million fans, but went in holiday and after a day "star news" reported I had disappeared, and I lost 6 million fans. I kept loosing more and more, it was ruling my life. All the time wasted doing the activities, I was not happy. Now onto enemy's, they are annoying and whatever you do you loose fans,and encounters with them are painfully boring and you will always loose. This game is not upto the rage and I'm #1 in my game, and I still get treated like dirt.so in all honesty i do not recommended this game.
I've been playing ever since the second this game launched and I am an S lister with 82 million fans.. Lately every time I finish a gig I get 3 more I now have like 9 gigs all lined up at different times and it's making me want to stop playing the game? Could you please change it back to getting a few gigs! Because there are to much and you can never get through all of them! Maria and Simon don't give you a choice whether or not you take the jobs they TELL you to you're going to do them. It's sooo frustrating!!! As a kardashian lover I would appreciate changing some things about this problem! Please! Because once people get up to my level they will feel the same! There is simply not enough time money or K koins
The game quits as soon as I enter it
Must have
Wow this game is cool and addictive
It's fun to dress up hard to get much money in a short time to get cool upgraded clothes..you'd have to wait for bait..and for some people there's too much going on.
I would have thought you would have fixed the connection issue by now but I can't connect at home, some internet is fine though. It's a really good game but it's a shame I can't play it! <f0><U+009F><U+008C><U+009F>
Love
It won't load I log out then in again but It dosen't work
Love it love it love it
The only downside is having to buy hairstyles with stats instead if money. The same with pets. Otherwise totally addicted and in love with this game!
I absolutely love this game!! I'm always playing it as it is so addicting!! Would be 5 stars if you could buy more with cash and not stars! Stars are hard to come by so would love more things available with cash
Game is so good! Best game ever!
Very addictive game, love it!! Wish the energy bolts would load faster & is a little annoying how you have to have the K coins to purchase things like hair styles. Could it be an option of both K coins & cash?
I love this game it os so awesome it is also so addicting this is awesome great graphics and everything.
Doesn't load fast enough. Annoying.
love this game, but it says can't connect to network everytime so I have to use my data, please could it be possible to fix in next update?!?!!! I wanna play all the time but eats my data!!!
this game is a waste ive never played it because it only says cant connect so dont get it cause its a piece of junk
this game is so addictive but is really cool
Its a great game but i think the stars should be easier to get and the things that cost stars shouldn't cost heaps but other than that i like it
It won't connect to the network so can't play ;( please fix this problem!? I would really like to play again!!! :D
This is a great game and it appeals to all ages.
Great app! If I had to improve it then maybe then the ability to customize tops and to have the clothing items be priced in both stars and coins.
"Before I was so angry about how it said I wasn't connecting to the wifi and now it loads for me instantly!
I have never loved a game so much in my life before!

I was totally in love with this game when I first downloaded it, but all of a sudden when I'm using a different wifi it always says there is a connection problem try again... It's really annoying and frustrating please fix this
This game is sooo addictive. The main goal is to move higher and higher in the Celebrity lists and you are encouraged to buy new clothing and accessories to further your chances, at a high price. So when I reached #1 on the A list I was disappointed to find that there is no big reward or even acknowledgement in the game for this. The game has become boring and tedious now that there isn't really anything to work towards. Sorry but save your time.
I really liked this game to begin with but I'm stuck with Luther unable to talk to me and therefore I am unable to progress. I also hate the 24 hour tasks!!
Good game, really interactive, I find the energy things annoying though. Otherwise a good game. <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0081>
reveals how stupid celebrities with no talent are and entire game is set up to attempt to steal your money
Goood
Love love love!!
I love this game but 80% of the time when I open it, it says I'm not connected to the internet when i am!!!
I haven't been able to play it because even though I clearly have wifi it's telling me I'm not connected and I'm not sure what to do!! It's getting really irritating because I only want to play it but its not letting me!!<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A3><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A0> ughhh please help..?:)
Impossible to play since it "can't connect" despite being connected! I see others' have had the same issue.
It's great it loads fast and its fun. There is just one thing that bugs me which is you need Internet connection to play,but that just me I think
Excellent
Did so many tasks/jobs and finally reach number 1. Now every time I open the application, it crashes. Please fix this.
It's are great game but sometimes it gets annoying cause everything item that looks great and fashionable is so expensive <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0082> and I'm sick of playing it one day and the next day if you don't play it you lose fans already then you drop but anyways it's are cool game to play <f0><U+009F><U+008E><U+00AE>
This game is my favorite game that I have on my iPod I'm on it 247 not really but you should get it and you will have no regrets
Fun but expensive. You can see y she made a killing from it. But still better than other games.
Addictive
Love it. Super fun and addictive xx
Won't coned to wifi, what's the point? Would be good game if you fixed this.
Can we get married on this game
Wtf is up with no wifi access? Get with the times!!!
energy should be refreshed faster, updates more regular
Love this game and totally addicted! Only downfall is updates need to be better & faster. Stuck on max level for almost a week now with nothing to do to gain fans.
Really really fun but the whole not being able to play on wifi is ridiculous. It uses all my data
Love this game
Already addicted
Fix the bugs!!! Was reaaalllyyy enjoying the game once i could connect and then I get to level 18 and I'm trying to complete best dressed goal and the shop so chic won't let me work to complete the tasks and now I can't collect my weekly earnings either ....really really disappointing I'm losing interest fast because I can't progress. Grrrrrrr<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+009E><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1>
My game connects with some wifi but not all, so I cant play it at home. But my main problem is how lame the hair is, can you get some more hair please? Then some clothes, shoes and pants. I'm sick of all the clothes, Kim Kardashian doesn't wear the same outfit twice why should I? Please make more in an update. x
I haven't been playing long and I'm already hooked ! I can't put it down.
I was so happy with this game but now it's glitched and I can't work in my store! (So chic) if this can be fixed I will be one happy camper
Fun but glitchy and freezes lots
This is a really good game but sometimes it doesn't load. You should be able to earn more money like real famous people
The game is good but wish you didn't have to buy/pat for itemd
I can not access the game from the the moment I hit b-list I couldn't get on the fame
I personally love the game, it's so addictive!!! Funny concept and I'm enjoying it <U+263A><U+FE0F>
Hilariously fabulous game. Pretty nice customisation keeps you entertained.
its really good
It would be easier to review this if I'd ever actually gotten to play it. Every time I try and open it, it says it can't connect to the network. Åaaand when I try to delete the app, my phone freezes. So that's fun.
:)
"I love this game!
But... I think there should be a ton more energy and it takes 5 minutes to get just 1 energy! 
I'm also unsure how to level up to other grades as letters.
Amazing Game apart from that <f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008F><f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008C><f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008D>"
For some reason it says I'm not connect to a network, when I am. So I can't actually play the game, can someone pease fix this
But unfortunately after I updated I go into the game and about 30 sec in the game it crashes ( not my connection, not needing more space. )
I love playing this game it is great fun
So much funnnn must download
Addicting game. But it's hard to get stars and all the cool stuff cost stars <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00AD> and the video thing for stars doesn't work..
Can never connect. Only worked twice. Yet it still send notifications?! Please fix!
This game is very good, logical and quite realistic. No annoying ads unless you want them. Just don't like how you need internet connection when they give you notifications when offline. But still love the game, forced all my friends to play it and I'm actually spending money on it haha!
I love this app!! But it won't work on my wifi and then I lose fans because it won't work on my wifi???? Please fix this!!! There is nothing wrong with my wifi!!!!!! <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A0><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A0><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1>
Too addictive... Wish I could buy all the stars!
Fun
The game is great and a lot of fun. Only problem that I have is the difficulty of earning energy in order to complete tasks and also the mission it is to get good hair! Maybe being able to purchase hair with money would be better than using stars.
Its soooo annoying !! I really really really wanna play but it keeps saying im not connected to a server ? Please please please fix this problem !!!!!:)
The main problem is the game seldom loads or opens up reliablely . It can take hours to get into the game very frustrating . I know lots of people gone off it because can t play it when you wZnt too . Annoying godown ranks coz game won't let you in . Not good
Keeping me busy
"The concept of the game is ok I suppose but will not work on wifi.
I'm not using my limited data to play."
amazing I'm addicted!
I cannot even get this to work as I get an error message saying cannot connect to the internet ... Waste of time, sort it out!
Getting so annoyed with the fact that I can't play on wifi connection. Not to mention that this game absolutely destroys my data. Grrr great game! Am addicted...provided I can play on wifi. Annoying.
Please! Everyone has been complaining about the internet it's really a great game it's just it's never loading!!!! Also if you could please get the energy to download faster that would be much more enjoyable but it's an awesome game I just hope I can play it...<f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0083> if it wasn't for the internet I would give it a 5...
Good game but can never connect via wifi always comes up with no connection try again, can only play game by using phone data
This game never works with wifi. I have to turn my hotspot on from my phone then connect the iPad. Please fix now.
It's a great game
It's really annoying how in the hair section you have to buy hair with stars? Why can't be buy hair with money? Like yeah there's a few hair you can buy with money but there quite ugly...  But besides that it's one of the best games I have ever played! Really enjoyable and also really fun! Keep the effort up! :)
I cannot connect to the game, it says cannot connect.
Its amazing
So addictive
So addicted !!
Stupid concept,how would make a game like this- no hard feelings  :(
As above ^
It is awesome. The only thing I don't like is that it takes 5 mins for only ONE ENERGY comes back. It should b 30 secs. Like another game I have. And also I HATE HATE HATE that u need wifi since I don't have it.
Way to many pop up ads
Such an addictive game but please fix the wifi problems!  It won't load - saying I'm not connected to the internet which I definitely am. It seems like everyone has the same problem so can you please fix it
Whenever I play this at my school it's fine but when I play it at home it's like not even working. Please fix this thanks lolz
I love this game when it came out. Played it everyday, but there is one problem; connection error. It keeps saying I have connection error but the thing is I don't because I checked my internet and it's fast and working, the only thing is that it's not working for the game so I was wondering can someone fix it??
Cool game
I love this game
Need to fix the wifi problem
Would be good if I could actually play this game through wifi rather than having to use my own data
A fantastic game and I would recommend it, however, you can't sell old properties. I have 3 and not much money so I was hoping I could sell 2. If you fix that it will be 5 stars!
So fun and addictive.
It a really good game but the problem with the wifi needs to be fixed because it's annoying not being able to get on to it!
This games is great, I love it so much I am on it every chance I get, I do wish I made more money :) but still love it - super addicting
Good
"It's a great game but honestly when you're and A lister with energy 27 it take literally 3 hours and when you are trying to do a shoot and you don't have much energy it just doesn't work and you loose fans and it's so annoying 

But overall I love it <f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008C>"
I like this game but I feel like we don't get enough money for all the over expensive things. Also there should be more ways to get more energy/extras than buying them. Other than that, great game
Good game but seriously addictive
You need to lower the prices? Like I'm only on level 5 and she wants $2k for an apartment? Man I just hit $500! Sheeeezzz.
Great game overall, looking forward to more updates in the future
Love the game but it's so frustrating trying to find your way round once you unlock the airport and that. I got so lost just trying to get back to New York that I spent all my money and had to restart the game because I had no money to get anywhere or do anything to earn money.
My wifi is connected but i cant seem to play i have been trying to but i haven't played once plz fix!!! <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A2><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A2><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A2><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A2><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A2>
"When I open the app it says that I'm not connected to the Internet!? I am definitely connected as I can download apps and stuff. Please fix this as I hear its a really cool game!
-Taylor"
This game is okay but it takes so long to load, it's laggy and this stupid game advert appears every two minutes. It becomes frustrating to play it. Apart from its slow progressing nature it could be cool! They should update it
Yeah it hardly loads
Fun game but crashes whenever an ad pops up. Please fix!
Wish I could try this game but it won't connect. EVER! I have never once been able to get further than the loading screen. Have deleted and re installed in but no difference. Guess this game is just like Kim herself. Disappointing and makes me angry.
Love this game and never had problems until I updated it and now with the new gates at airports it's too confusing and I've checked everything and can't go to certain cities
I've heard that this game is amazing but mine says it won't connect to the network even when I'm standing right by my wifi source. I have tried uninstalling it and then re installing it but still no help. Because of great reviews I want this game, help?
I would enjoy this game if I didn't receive the 'network' error 9/10 times of trying to play. It's ridiculous - sort it out!!
Before the update, it would take me around 10-20 minutes to load but not the connection glitch is finally fixed! I can now go on the game and it will take 5 seconds! Thank you so much and I love the game so much!!!! And please update the clothes, I love this game!
Can't load because apparently 'I'm not connected ' or 'can't connect' XD
Can't connect to the game. VERY frustrating because I loved the game
"This is a good game but it keeps saying I need to check my network connection and wont let me play
Apart from that the game is great"
"I would enjoy this game more if the energy wasn't so scarce and it didn't take hours to complete each task. Other than that it's good to play. 
Oh, and I agree with the other reviews in terms of internet connection, not the best sometimes."
Internet connection on this game is horrible
Once you know how to play it is amazing but for the first couple of days you have no idea what the heck is going on
So addicting and amazing ahhh
I am honestly so annoyed about the can't connect . I just updated the app and nothing has changed it won't work . I'm going to be deleting this game have been waiting long enough .
I love this game so much!!! So obsessed
Fun game, but takes alot of energy to fill up one star. Iv used all my 24 stars and not even quarter up one star.
Good fun all around though
It's been two updates since the connection hasn't worked, and this one I thought would really fix it. Really annoyed that I can't play it please fix
So I've spent at least $20 on this app but I'm having major problems it says the wifi is not working please help <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00AB><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00AD>
This is so fun and so easy it's great :D
Cool
bible
I just got the newest update, and it's started crashing :---( please fix
It's a great game but it's disappointing that you don't earn money like a real celebrity. Like getting $50,000 for doing something, and then at least if the did that they could set car prices at $80,000 and houses $500,000+. The Clothes are pretty much the price of what a celebrity would pay, and when you only earn $200+ (Even when you're a A list celebrity) for doing a job it's pretty hard to buy things. I think the higher in the list you get the more money you should get, If they want people to feel Like a A lister they should pay more. :) I also think you should be able to take the person you're dating to photo shoots or events :)
Very cool
A really good game .Would be my fav except when you open it it insists there's a connection problem but there's not!  :( And the updates dont fix it!I won't be buying any stars if I can't use them!
I love this game so much. And the quality is amazing. Although sometimes when I open the game it says "Cant Connect to a Network" when I clearly am.
Once I got to b lister this game got so boring, I just couldn't be bothered to waiting for energy or just playing. SO BORING.
Love this game, so addicting
I love it!!!!
I need to make A Grade. And I need that hot outfit for 50 Kim K stars. Gotta go get back to the game.
Fix it please
Really fun
Very addictive! <U+2B50><U+FE0F><U+2B50><U+FE0F><U+2B50><U+FE0F>
Sometimes when I click on something the screen goes white and now it's not doing anything what do I do
I want to give it a 5 star rating for the game cause it's really good BUT I'm not enjoying this loading part where you first initially enter the game. Constant. "No network , try again" keeps popping up. Please fix this problem It will let me play the game once than after that it no longer lets me play. I'll be happy to change my star rating to a 5 when this problem is fixed.

"This game is really fun and easy to use.
One thing that could be worked on is that I have the game on my iPod an recently I got a tablet so I tried to log into the same Facebook account on not to see if I could load saved data but it would not work. I don't know if this hasn't been made to happen or if it is just my device but it would be amazing if I was able to play the same game on both devices! 
Thanks!"
I love this game it's so fun but the only thing is when I click on the app it always comes up with "can't connect" when I have my wifi connected also? So I always have to use my 4g then turn my wifi back on when I'm playing the app <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0092>
It's fun but keeps loosing connection even though I'm in wifi
Love this game, really addictive but it takes too long to recharge energy. Would like to play more than 2 minutes at a time as it is quite annoying
Never been able to get past the loading screen. Keeps saying it can't connect to network. My internet connection is fine. Needs to be fixed. Waste of time.
I've heard the game is really good, but I can't actually play it. There is a notification that says the network connection isn't working or something. I've tried on both my phone and iPad soooo...
Great game!!
"GURRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRLLLLLLLLLL

THIS GAME IS MY LIFE.

Who needs friends, fresh air and sunlight when I got this."
I have downloaded the game and it keeps saying network error when everything is fine and I clearly have connection??! I really want to play this game! Please help!!!
Loves it
"I cant use it on wifi
Is,kwkka,"
Please fix the Internet connection thing it's not working please fix !!!!!! <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1><f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+00A1>
Kim has done a great job with this game.
This game is sooo fun and addicting
I absolutely love this game it's so addicting <f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008F><f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008F><f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008F><f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008F><f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008F><f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008F><f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008F> but it usually says the networks down and it would be better if you didn't need Internet to play but I STILL LOVE THIS GAME
This game is amazing!! But you need to let it change your name cause my name has a typo and also I don't like the energy idea it's sorta lame... But still amazing and addicting!!
I'm connected to the internet. But I can't play. It is a fun game. But I did want to play it on my road trip today.. But I couldn't because I needed wifi. But even when I'm at home, it says there's no wifi, but I can go on Facebook and other stuff. But not this game. Please fix it!
The game can't connect fix it.
This game has ruined my life.
Love this game, totally addictive however..the constant connection era is very frustrating! I also find the negative comments from people you date incredibly unnecessary. Lighten up a little and please fix the connection glitch.
The connection is so frustrating ! I am so disappointed with this app
Great game but it will never work on my internet, always says I don't have connection when I do :(
its really fun but youneed to fix connection problem it never works
Loving the game but the connecting to network needs to be fixed as it works fine on my 4G but not on wifi, I have to start the game on 4G then turn on my wifi and it works which is really annoying. Also I think the amount of stars that need to be used to get some stuff is ridic in my opinion. I also think there should be more interaction for example with the dating, make it more exciting and let the user be more involved.
Best game I've played
It's a fun game, entertaining and different... However, I think the game would attract more players if you did not constantly need WiFi to play,  most games nowadays you can play with or without connection to the Internet. Another issue I have found is regarding the energy bar, for some activities you cannot completely finish them due to how slow the energy takes to reload, if you have a 30 minute activity and 20 units of energy with some items you have to do being up to 8 units then how can you pass when you have to wait 20 or more minutes for the energy to reload? Also, household items, houses/condos and clothes are quite expensive too, by the time you finish buying items to carry on with the game and then level up you can't buy the new clothing, hairstyles etc that you want. However, I do enjoy the game a lot, it's fun but please remember that it's a game...don't make us feel like we can't be a Kardashian or a Kardashian friend in real life or in a game! 4/5 stars, everyone should still download if you have WiFi you're going to have fun!
Fix the bug that means I can't speak to Luther! Have already paid my rent and way past that stage, just can't speak to Luther for no reason! Not the only one with this problem! Really frustrating because I can't progress! Sitting at #1 and now I can't do anything!!!
Ah same thing happened!! It has no internet connection when I do have internet connection! Please please please fix!! But on the plus side I really love this game!
I love this game! #addicted <3
Can't go on the game even when I have Internet on
I'm #1 on a list and there's nothing really to do anymore....
When ever I try to play this game it says I have not connection when I have 3 bars of wifi, fix this please
Ok just like everyone else I cannot play this game because apparently I don't have an internet connection when I clearly do! This is such an enjoyable game when I play it at my friends house but I can't play it and it's so annoying!!!
I absolutely love this game! It's so addicting, but it says it can't connect to the internet at home, where as it works at school. My internet is perfectly fine because all my social media and internet games work fine. It gets really annoying if I'm doing a task or on a date. Please fix this glitch.
When I first downloaded the game, I couldn't play cause of connections to the internet though it is connected to our wifi. The latest update comes out and I managed to play it on the day but now I can't connect again - can you at least fix that bug please ;)
PLEASE FIX THIS!!! - I like this game, but it always says that the network connection is down, even with full connection. Fun, but please fix. I've re-downloaded, tried opening it in the App Store updated it and still it tells me there's a problem with my network connection, even with full connection. Ugh, otherwise it would be a great game. Please don't ignore.
Solid game mean as bro shot ow kimmy girl bro cheea cheea...x
Great game. However it keeps telling me that there is a connection error even when there is wifi. I noticed I'm not the only one who is experiencing the same problem. Please fix the bug in the new update.
absolutely addicted to this game except it's biggest downfall is the stupid wifi connection! it works on some wifis but not others, really frustrating and prevents me from playing and enjoying the game! <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0092> please sort this issue out
Kia Ora I think that you should start the game from Zlist so users feel they have a higher goal to reach in order to keep them playing for the final moment of A list because frankly, e is just to close to a. The shoots are quite repetitive so you should think of a more creative way to include the user instead of the simple tapping. PLEASE stop people breaking up with me, it's such a drag and I think I should be in control of my relationship, or at least make them dateable again without having to use stars. Energy is alright, it keeps players coming back for more but you should think of some way you can earn energy (yes I know about tapping around) by talking to certain people or doing a Kim k pop quiz etc. I love the game bless your soul. Kia kaha
I really like this game, but for some reason it won't connect to the wifi! It's so frustrating. Please please please fix this bug!!!
Addicting game. If energy could load faster and not be so repetitive would be 5/5. New update is great as now no connection error <f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008D>
Good game but keeps telling me I'm not connected to a network when I clearly am, please fix this problem and the game would be awesome
Says I have no wifi connection when I'm at home but I do??? Great game but wifi bug is so annoying
Sup this is an awesome game but it never lets me go on it says no internet but I know I have internet and everyone is going where has echo gone sigh I am still here on the b list :( ( btw my name is echo )
IT NEVER WORKS FOR ME EVER! It never even works for my friends! PLEASE FIX!!!
This so called "connection error" is stupid. It annoys the hell out of me that I can't play it. Please fix it. <U+270C><U+FE0F>
Fun
Not what I'd expected pretty fun and entertaining
I can't play on my iPad 90% of the time because there an imaginary connection error. My wireless is always connected. It's a fun app, just wish I could play it more.
Best
would be a good game if they would fix the bugs :( !!!!
Awesome game I love Kim kardashion !! It's super duper fast and fun and easy to play on 5s
Like everyone else it doesn't connect to the wifi ughhhh so annoying
I've been pushing try again many times it just won't connect
"Hello there,
I am very disheartened because this game never loads it is so frustrating!! What am I supposed to do during school?! Sort it out Kim please!!"
As seems to be a recurring problem for a lot of people, the game wont let me connect on my wifi. Have to use data which is lame. Its an addictive game otherwise and i was really enjoying it until i updated and now wont let me play at all :( please fix this, rather horrible in my opinion
This game is great!! Nli peev I have is tht it takes sooo looong to refil energy!!! If that was faster it would be worth 5 stars!!! Jus saying...
The game is addicting but the internet connection thing is being weird. I can't play it at school because it won't let me so please fix that <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0080> but overall it's a great game
Cool game but really annoying when you can't get in for hours
It won't let me even go into the game!!!
Loved this game but says it won't connect! Fix now !!!
This game is really good but every time I go into it now it says I haven't got an internet connection when I do. Please fix this quick!!
It only works with my 3G. Please get this sorted. It's frustrating.
Took awhile for game to load first time opening but since then smooth sailing.
Love the game, if only it worked on wifi! Also I purchased some stars so I wouldn't get ads anymore yet I still get ads... Great game but bugs sorted would make it spectacular!
.... My friends who play this game don't show up in my friends lists at all.... Can you fix this or make it better???
Game is fine. It's a pain sometimes to find where I have to go and game won't work when using wifi!!
Fav game but says I can't connect all da tym
Can't use!!!internet saying not working and all of my k stars disappeared and I had 40!!and didn't use them :(
Getting super fed up with the "check your connection" thing popping up!! Hasn't allowed me to play the game in 3 days! Driving me up the wall!!!!!!
"I would reeeeally like to play this game but it hasn't even given me a chance. Apparently I have no connection when I have full bars. 
This is so disappointing as I've heard it's a great game, I just can't see that for myself. Please fix this, I want to play it. Instead of it being a waste of space on my iPod."
The game is so good. But the connection error and Simon won't call back really ruin this game. Please fix it.
Be weary you rarely get the rewards provided for filling out surveys and signing up to other bits and pieces and paying for it.
Says network error -.-
I really want to try out this game but anytime I open it on my ipad it says 'connection error' even when I have full bars. I even tried deleting it and re-downloading it but it NEVER works. I thought it was just me but this happens to my friend as well. Please fix this bug because everyone is saying how fun it is and I want to try it.
Does not connect to wifi
This game isn't to bad <f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008D>
It's pretty good but like it stops telling you where everything is and it takes ages to find places
Love the game but I can never get it too load only sometimes and it's really frustrating and annoying
Omg This game is so good
I absolutely love this game it's so much fun and very exciting its great fun and I love the kardashians so 5 stars completely
Not bad kim K, not bad at all x<f0><U+009F><U+008C><U+009F><f0><U+009F><U+008C><U+009F><f0><U+009F><U+008C><U+009F>
It's a awesome game xx
I just downloaded the game and can't play because it says there's no Internet connection even though there is. I haven't even played it once. Please fix this bug because I really want to play it.
It connects with my phone data with no problems but when im connected to the Wifi it doesnt work ?
"Needs more fans. I'm already at the max for this update/: just make it unlimited! I'm losing my motivation to play because I can't get more fans/: also fix the wifi bug thing. Rather painful to deal with.
Love the game so much though!"
Cfg
It's keeps saying connection error! So annoyed. Is this happening with anyone else?
This game is so addictive :)
"Theres a bug that constantly says 'connection error' when I have full bars. No matter what I do I still can't get on. I have tried turning my iPod on and off and deleting the game and re downloading it, but it still won't work. Until this bug gets fixed i dont recommend anyone downloading however some people are finding it ok. 

Please fix the bug and then maybe the game will be worth more stars."
The game hardly ever opens, I love it when it does but that's only occasionally!
Like most, abit of a connection error but will work sooner or later. Super addictive I love it!!!
Please can you fix the connecting error I really what to play the came but I can't because it won't connect to my wifi,
Now that you have put out an update it no longer says can not connect which makes the game great. This game is so addictive but can get very repetitive which makes me bored and stop playing for a while.
Love this game but has trouble loading sometimes.
"well you see sir, I was in the middle of a very important photo shoot at GLAM mag mate and then the phone won't connect with wifi. 
C'mon please get it together this game is very very important to my health."
It's a really fun game! Should be like mini games to earn extra money
Really pissing me of how it's not connecting through wifi, and I've run out of 4g and it's not Algood because I need to play <f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008D>
Pleeeease fix the connect to internet/wifi bug or what ever ... I can only connect from time to time and also shorten the waiting period for the energy , it takes soo long !! other than that the game is amazing !! <3
Addicting but amazing I love it.
Great game. Takes ages to load sometimes but really addictive :)
This is the worst game I have ever bought it lags and won't connect to the Internet no mater where I go it will send me notifications but when I open it it say 'can't connect' so I will not recommend it to any one actually I will tell them not to get it.
Great game but it says I can't connect when I do have wifi...very frustrating!
I haven't been able to play this game for weeks and after you updated I got hope that you fixed the connection but it still says I'm not connected when I defiantly am. Please fix this!
Cool
Love this game! But I hate the connection problem, I can only play when my data is on. Please fix this!
I did not spend $60 in-game just for the app to tell me it's having internet connection issues when everything else is connected and works fine!
Love the game! So obsessed but can you fix the connection. So annoying not being able to play it on wifi
Tight
such a cool game good work kim <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0098>
Another update, another faulty Kim Kardashian game. Fix it already!
"I haven't even got to play this game yet and it keeps telling me that I can not connect to the Internet 
This is very frustrating because no matter how many times i try to re download it ,it just doesn't the same thing 
Please fix this then I will give 5 stars 
Thanks"
Love the game, just need to get the 'cannot connect try again' bit fixed
Energy takes so long to renew but other than that it's a good game
Every time i try play it says it cant connect to the network! Even though my iphone is connected on the Wifi
"I'm starting to become tired of this game and soon I probably won't bother 
there's no point opening a task because in the end you can't get into the game because it ""can't connect"" 
This has been a problem for a long time and doesn't seem to be resolved
I don't think I'd recommend anyone download this game till the problem is fixed"
"It won't let me play and just says ""can't connect""

I want to try it out"
I would definitely recommend this game, it's fun for dress up and business. It's extremely entertaining, I'm hooked already. :)
It's fun and addicting except for the energy part!! I  keep running out! Haha jk love it it's perf
ADDICTED!
"How to mine money in the App Store: 
1.take a well known franchise, if it was a popular video game before then great
2. Make the game about building, with real time waits of hours - much easier than making, you know, a game that you play.
3. make these waits impossibly long or even just shamelessly add features that are impossible without the user spending a lot of money IRL.

Sound familiar? It's about half of what you find in the App Store nowadays.

I just feel bad for the people who had to make this app, they probably have fond memories of playing the original too and I'm sure they didn't enjoy carving it up like this. 
Take a lesson from the GTA apps, or Simcity."
Like everyone else. Connection issues. Kicking off raids etc.
The game was great until it lately started kicking me out of raids due to lost connection. It's the only game that experiences this issue, and as a result I've uninstalled it.
The best casual game around.
GET THIS GAME!!! Seriously, this game is awesome!!!
"The original was genius. Imagine stripping everything that made the original great, and replacing it with a shameless money grab. Depressing as all get out. 
This game isn't free. It isn't playable unless you fork out a fortune, and it isn't worth that. Avoid. No, actually, download, play five minutes, then rate."
Please read your reviews was good but something is wrong here, game will often lose connection or at least report it has kick you out of raids count that as a loss, you lose any resources and minions you had started to use and that's it!! It's not internet connection as no other apps have issues streaming works fine, while your at it build a proper Dungeon Keeper III for PC like the originals just updated and modern please!!
Great app.
"Constantly bugged with in app purchases

Very sad, this was a really good game in the 90s. Perfect too port over too iOS. Yet EA have killed it. 

Would rather buy a paid for version that actually allows me too play the fame."
Just loaded the app, guest what? Can't get connection. So far can't play the game, so 1 star for me!
Really enjoy it a real fun download
Not a bad app but doesn't capture the feel of the original game by a long shot.
Have been playing this game for a while, but won't even load now.whats going on???seems like I'm not the only one
Keeps going off and restarting i will not download again rubbish do not get it
Fix it please great game
Quality time killer
You need gems to speed up process but it says the best value to buy gems is your ready for this?69 pounds!! No the best value is to go on good old games  and buying the original dungeon keepers one and two for like ten pounds!
Played this years ago on PC so a trip down memory lane. So good so far.
And tutorial restarts over and over again. Unplayable
Love it already a Premium Member just for the memory's of the PC version
It's a wonderful game, great deal of fun
Please fix!! Connection keeps crashing
All this game does since the update is crash. It won't even get past the loading screen. This game is really awesome when it actually works so get your s*** together EA and actually do something good for your players for once.
Great little game this I have had no problems with it (iPad Air) although I'm not far into the game as of yet I'll keep ya posted <f0><U+009F><U+0091><U+008D>
New version is very buggy. Screen freezes often and upon completing a new challenge, it randomly reset advising I had to do it again!
I've been playing this game for a while and it has now become unplayable. With the connection constantly dropping out, I cannot do anything within the game. I do raids and half way through the connection drops and when it reconnects I've been sent back to my dungeon and had my minions removed... Now you can blame my internet connection but as I play other games of this style with no issues, it can't be that... I think this app needs sorting out desperately! For now I strongly suggest you don't waste your time on this app!
The only thing that really grinds my gears is if your raid and get disconnected you don't get anything refunded if you have used gems for the raid..
Still haven't sorted out the crash problems. Horny would not be pleased. You should be slapping your staff, not you customers.
Just like the original Dungeon Keeper with a Clash if Clans twist. Love it A++++
Unless you have a couple million to spend on this game, don't even bother with it
This game is fantastic. Very addictive. Am kind of wondering how it can be upgraded as the the dungeon has limited space and gems.
"Loved this game on pc so when i saw it was available on iphone i had to get it.
Problem is, it hardly works and constantly crashes. I cant progress because i cant raid and because of this i cant upgrade anymore. This really needs sorting out because this is one of the best games available. Would love to give 5 stars but only gets one until the bugs are sorted."
Like it bit better than clash of the clans !!
This game is great. Ive played since i owned it on pc for windows 95. However when i downloaded it for ios i thought the changes were fantastic as well as the multiplayer interface but the amount of times this game has crashed since ios 8 came out cause me to loose a lot of work during raids and events is just ridiculously frustrating. From such a large game developer i was expecting a lot better support and so much extra reaction when a game is going downhill.
Woch out the game got taken from me as I put miny on all ways keep loged in to Game Center!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Good game allwayz play it couple of faults but still play it :)
Great game best of its genre
Been playing for a long time and recently an old bug has reappeared for me. On raids, a chunk of my army suddenly stops working. They just stand there and keep shooting or hitting a dead room/enemy. The enemies ignore them completely and they are effectively removed from play. Especially happens to trolls but I've has warlocks and necromancers seize up to. Please fix it.
The tournaments are unplayable because it boots you out when you start playing and you lose your rewards. This is clearly not happening to everyone so is a bug. Sort it out!!! You're making enough money out of people I expect you to provide a game that works!
Great game
Great strategy maze base great game 3D models no faults. The times have been lowered a lot
I like this game but everytime I ve got slow or lost connection to internet I lost the game and winning streak :(
Have played this for a few months and really like it. Always something to play or change and a bit of a challenge too
Seriously need to sort this problem out with it reloading during an attack its happened to me 4 times in a row it's becoming a big problem sort it out please
Game doesn't work with Mobile Data and occasionally not with Wi-Fi. As for the game if you are  expecting anything close to the original awesome Dungeon Keepers you'll be disappointed with this awful game if you want something to keep you occupied on a smoke break and on the loo this will do.
"Constantly has to keep reloading , loses connection on event raids and you can not resume 

Don't bother very disappointing until connection issues are fixed"
Although it's not as good as the classic, i think it's fun enough! I enjoy playing a lot ;)
Great game, Not enough hours in the day.
"A simple game to get your head around and a good kind of addictive! Building up your defences takes time but good fun to explore and pick fights! 
I really recommend to anyone who doesn't mind leaving it a while and going back to it just to get resources!"
I'm a huge fan of the original PC game and this has everything the original version has. Worth a download and play. Ignore the bad reviews. They clearly don't have a sense of humour
Ever since I got the game I've constantly checked up on it and I always find the time to get back on doing whatever but it becomes quite annoying sometimes. I'll be sitting playing when out of nowhere the game will notify me that "imps are preparing the dungeon" I'm not really sure why the game has to constantly decide to load up again even though I've sat playing for hours anyway. That's really the only problem I have and it's quite a downer considering half the time I'm scared to raid other dungeons incase the game reloads again and ruins the win streak. Other than that I'm always addicted and it's quite a funny game.
"The game itself is a good one enjoy the imp slapping lol
But the reloading issues make it very hard to keep a good win streak going as one battle has started and it reloads you have lost the match your troops and magic fixing these problems would vastly improve the game but as others on this review have noted the same problems I can't see this happening too soon"
Great game n different ways to attack n defend. A shame it keeps crashing to reload, I'm absolutely Fed up with it reconnecting, start a raid etc n it'll just reload back to your own Dungeon. Can't start a raid or nowt. I'm on an iPhone 4
"Few bugs. Cancels out every now and again during raids. 
Not as good as the original. Bring back some of the original 90s characters. 
Buying imps needs to be easier too."
Very good one of my best games to play
Good game but prefer the original PC Game, that was awesome.
I enjoy playing the game but if you start a raid and the game crashes you get punished for it and it counts as a loss. It crashes quite often right at the beginning of a raid on another dungeon keepers dungeon. Needs fixing!
Good ol' classic made smaller pocket style!
"during the last tourny and before there seems to be a lot of disconnection issues, which has resulted in me loosing out on points, gems and immortals? Will this be an ongoing problem or should I cut my losses now? The games quite good not as good as the original might I add but still a fun play when it works, some feedback as to why this happens would be nice as I'm fed up of loosing gems

Cheers"
I loved the original - I bought it in the 90s and it was awesome, but this version, although nostalgic, just doesn't have the same gameplay experience. If I lose connection the game freezes and the game spends more time loading than dungeoneering. One of the great things that I miss from the original is the sense of urgency in the gameplay. It's here, but I've spent so long waiting to get to that part that it gets replaced with frustration instead.
Great game.
After hoping this game would be released for several years I'm really happy to see it.  It does have some teething problems but then what new game does not!  Excellent multiplayer tower defence with amazing playability and upgrade options.
Unfortunately this game is not compatible with iPhone 6, there are just way too many bugs like no pinch zoom and sound issues.
Good game but doesn't load anymore :(
Takes me back to when I used to play this on the PC
Very addictive game with good game play but many faults make it very frustrating to play. The build times are slow tempting you to buy tokens to skip it. During raids if for any reason a connection drops low it will end the game and punish you for it loosing game play and win streaks. Very slow, it's a shame they didn't just make this a paid game and keep the original structure, would be happy to pay for the game once, but paying for over priced tokens I will not do! - sort out the online game play crashing please or it is another game that I delete due to been ruined by having to be constantly online!
Best game in ages!
Good to while away a couple of minutes
Get the minions slapped, order your attackers and prepare your defences. An excellent solo game, but really comes alive with online raids! Buy your minions early!
"Excellent game, most played game on my phone :)) - looks like the new phone update has thrown up bugs though!!

Network connection : Throws me out of a session even when in battle, looses my minions doesn't update cup score + or - .

My only other want is somehow be able to get rid of guild members that don't commit and play - that have not visited the game for a length of time. 

Cheers :)"
"If you don't pay for gems expect to be stuck upgrading items for days by the time you're at level 5.

I'll probably delete it now as its pointless."
Maybe for the Gen x/y this is a good game for those who remember DK 1 & 2 on the PC, this is pretty poor and a cynical money pit. Hold out for 'War for the Overworld'.
"snoozefest, even though i loved the original.
very long loading times between screens, its painfully dull

EA just keep on grossly misunderstanding mobile gaming, whilst the nimble supercell are cleaning up."
Well I was enjoying this game, and I would be more stars, however in this latest update it will not load, so if you want to be frustrated by building up your dungeon then being "locked out" of it download and pull your hair out.
"This is a fantastic game which I've wasted endless hours on. Being a great fan of the original, this takes the high level concept and simplifies this for the mobile market.
Still addictive and can be picked up when ever you have a spare 5 mins!
Latest update is very buggy and crashes my game midway (annoying, since all minions are lost which have been committed).
Please fix this and restore this game to its former glory!"
"Very addictive enjoyable game.  I would like to see more control with non-immortals in the gameplay.

:-)"
It's not like the real 1 at all!!! but a very good app once you get into it.
Addictive, good play albeit time consuming. Not a touch on the original and it takes an age to get anywhere.... Zzz
Dungeon keeper was a fast paced and exciting game on the PC. This looks like the original dungeon keeper but is ridiculously slow unless you want to buy gems. This 'free' game has been ruined by the need to charge for advancement. I'd much prefer to pay an upfront set amount. Micro charging is just  greed!
Good stuff.
Great game but very frustratingly never connects whilst on 4G meaning it's pretty much a wifi only game... Actually, not sure it connects to the server at all anymore
If your not going to regularly buy in game gems... This is a massive waste of time! Giving it one star is overly generous!
Love it.... keeps me going for hours, wish I could slap more imps though!!! <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+009C>
Great fun takes u back to the old days on pc good all round graphics
Good ap but don't get suckered into paying any. £
The game is fun but not worth playing anymore, as I am repeatedly kicked out of my attack of another keeper's dungeon for no reason. Does anyone else have this problem? All I can really do is improve my own dungeon now.
Don't get me wrong, this game is great. Plenty of strategy and what not but the most annoying this is the fact that it is so unreliable. It constantly cuts off if your wifi connection is remotely low (and in a game with attacks and fighting points it is important). They are constantly updating and upgrading things but it never gets better. There are always new bugs and things not quite right. Here's hoping future updates will be far better because if it gets worse - regrettably I will have to give up.
Great playability, if you got the bucks, and bugs galore!
I know the new rights owners are playing on the following of the original PC version player of Dungeon Keeper but the game regularly will not start. I actually wish I could give this game 0 stars
Fun way to kill time
I loved the original Dungeon Keeper series and had high hopes for this. Starts off well, has good features like being able to invade other dungeons, take revenge on those who have tried to wreck yours but the app is ruined by the unbelievably high IAP costs. A real shame, it could have been great.
Cheap and nasty completely fails to capture the magic of the original games. Very bad gameplay keeps crashing and stopping to load halfway through a raid causing you to lose everything you'd gained
If you see the game for what it is (a part time game) it's a winner!!
The only thing good about this game is the voice which they kept from the original game. Terrible piece of crap. I have a working version of DK running on windows 8 and the things that go on in that dungeon still amaze and amuse me 15 years on. If gta 3 can be reissued for the mobile and tablet them so can DK.
"Deep strategy, Dungeon building, PvP action and dark humour. Excellent throughout. Whatever glitches they had with the update seems to be fixed as I've not experienced it. 

One of the best games on the iPad"
"I've been playing DK for around 2 months now, I wasn't aware of the previous version so was shocked to see all the negative comments.  I delved further into these and decided I wouldn't spend any money and to see how the game progressed.  

Ok so I still haven't spent any money and guess what?  I love it, this game only gets better in my mind.  Sure it's crashed once or twice and I've emailed and been met with prompt responses.  

If you want strategy and are prepared to go in for the long haul then this is the game for you!"
Wow this game is brutal, like hundreds before me I downloaded with anticipation only to find the greedy fatcats have been at it again. If this was the game rehashed I'd have paid £10-20 bucks no problem. Unfortunately it's not. It's a newfangled 'how can we make as much money as possible' kind of game. Avoid it and find the original for the PC.
Loads of fun, obviously the game hinges on gems and that's EA way of generating their own income. That being said the raid functions are fantastic, which conversely has stopped me playing the campaign missions as the loot just isn't good enough.
Could be great, but utterly ruined by the pay-to-win model. Such a disappointment!
Lots of fun to play but a lot of pushes are made towards micro transactions which are off putting. Gameplay is almost the same as clash of clans with minor differences.
This is horrible, it completely rects the original series and remove the god damn waiting times.
"Brilliant game in the day and this version is very addictive and challenging but with spending a fortune of real money of gems it takes forever to play.  Sign of our times.. :-(

Since the update the game has become a lot better balanced and is a lot easier to play without gems."
Last update was a disaster. Now it won't even start and just constantly crashes out. A good game made unplayable.
I like the update -not nearly so bad as some of these reviews make out. The new single square tunneling is better imo (speaking as mainly a defender the old way was always annoying) and the layout is nice. However, when I try to log on there only seems to be a 50/50 chance the game will load and the 'please wait....' messages in game still wind you up particularly mid-attack when you automatically lose the battle. Overall the update is good even if it seems to favour defense -but then why should it be easy for others to waltz in and smash your beloved dungeon to bits?
This update has managed to turn a 5* game into a 2* game. I have been building my dungeon for months but attacking now can sometimes be pointless. My trolls no longer seem to attack bug zappers and now you have to have your disable trap skill to a certain level before you can disable bug zappers. Run into one of them and I have had it, no way to stop it now!Why did you do it ... :( looks like this will be a game if I have to uninstall :(
I'm a big dan of the Dungeon Keeper franchise and this game didn't disappoint :-)
Disappointed. It's not.
It's not the original but it's still very addictive and I love it
Dungeon keeper 1 and 2 were 2 original and amazingly fun games, Not online rubbish. If they released one of them again i would buy it as im sure many others would, this is a massive letdown the only good thing is slapping the imps, many games tried to mimic the originals and failed dk3 would have been a success without fail and a lot of people were shocked to hear the game got dropped, one day the dk series may come back but with this attempt its defiantly not today. Good luck but this is just a cheap rubbish mobile game and not deserving of the dk series name!
This app is brilliant and I have the computer version too and the app version is just as good and is a simpler one! :) xxx
Latest version has Lots of bugs, really frustrating and updates negate a lot of the time and achievements earned to date. Previous strategies to build your dungeon in a certain way have just been made redundant. UX team need to actually play the game, not guess at it
Some one needs to sort the troll glitch out, or your going to lose players Including me, they just stand there hitting nothing.... Sort it out fast
"I like the update

Yes it's made raiding harder, but finally you can spend gold, got bored of sending in maxed out dragon whelps & tiny which nobody could defend.

Will update in a week on feedback,  most of these moaners are 3000- 6000 keepers like myself who will have to rework their tactics"
The update is awesome i just can't wait for the next update
Played the game for many years on PC and was excited to see it on iphone, seem to have done a good job! Wish it was back on the pc though!
I really enjoyed this game up until the last update. Won't be playing it again if it stays like this.
It's really fun to play
The game now crashes almost every time you try and raid.  Terrible update.
Ive spent alot of money on gems on this game, loved it at 1st. Now wenever there is an update i know its gonna be crap. Now u have to upgrade chicken an bolder :/ wat are u thinkin. An i have to upgrade my heart to dig blue blocks? Wat a joke. If this update isnt removed my whole guild are gna stop playing, plus many other guilds, Sort it out befor you lose all the people that loved it. Trying to make more money is one thing, but ur gna end up losing everyone that plays it.
Many moan, but I really like this game. You don't need to spend on in app p's, you just need a little patience.
"After latest update I just keep getting unable to connect to server. :(

Updated: from 1 star to 3 stars. I can now start the game. I haven't had time to see if I can turn off the tutorial."
I am really enjoying this game, tower defence style which I don't normally like but really fun
"This latest update is extremely annoying. Wish I hadn't updated. The whole thing looks even cheaper (didn't think that was possible). It feels much less solid now. The voiceover parts are now beyond cringeworthy. 
The new user interface has actually confused things and made gameplay clunky and awkward on the small iPhone screen. Can't see the total amount of gold and stone storage available now when looking over the dungeon.
The way in which one uses spells such as the disable trap spell has been changed and the user not advised of this change. It works less well now.
Shame, as I was starting to rather like this new version of the classic Dungeon Keeper game. I'd managed to get over the cheap appearance.
The constant disconnection when raiding other dungeons used to be absolutely awful.
Hopefully at least that is better now...we shall see!"
Massively addictive and hugely annoying, gems should me a little more obtainable, cos I ain't spending money on in game purchases
Is the best game here so far.. Old skool
After investing time and money in this game, the latest update has turned it into a pathetic, bland, frankly ridiculous farce.... I want my money back... Changing the game this much in an update is ludicrous... I loved the remake prior to the update that changed everything, whoever made the decision to shaft loyal existing users with the latest update must be on crack... Please refund me, I have a bad taste in my mouth now... Shame on you EA.
Played this game for months and now this new update. They have Change how spells work and how I now need to defend my dungeon. RUINED THIS GAME EA.
"After downloading this new upgrade it seems to crash a lot more than the old one,having to close the app and and reopen it several times. The new layout isn't so bad but prefer the old one as when opening the app it doesn't tell you that you've been attacked unless closing the app and reopening from scratch. 

Don't download new upgrade...."
What possessed ea to make such massive changes to the game is beyond me. It has ruined my experience.
Doesn't work after last update plz fix
Upgrades take a while but I'm really enjoying building my dungeon and attacking others. 5 stars!
If it weren't published by EA.
Don't bother, the latest upgrade has totally ruined this game!
I liked the last update, I like the new look and layout, fair enough I had to rearrange a few things but overall a massive improvement..
Worth a try but the original game is still just a faint memory . Listen EA if u want to make money make the original game just more levels change nothin ! Gimi 15 levels with no changes new n il transfer £40 from PayPal now !!!!
"Loved the dungeon keeper gold but this is nothing like ! They want you to spend £70 on virtual gems (cash cow) no tunnelling to the next keeper ! Should've kept to the original concept ! Getting bored after two days
Update and make it fun then you may get some cash in guys!!!!!!
Slow slow slow ! Upgrades takes forever
When you improve then I'll change my review"
"Although I am enjoying this game for what it is, I do prefer the original DK games. Would be nice if E.A could remake the original with some updates allowing for touch screen etc and make it a pay for app (without the need to buy gems) I'm pretty that they would sell a hell of a lot of copies.

The only problem I have with this version of the of the game is you need imps to build faster, but to get more imps you need gems and as you start buying them, the cost drastically jumps with each one you buy (oh, plus you need gems to buy 2 of the 4 immortals). So the only way to progress as quickly as possible is, the same as most games nowadays, is if your rich and can blow money on these games like there's no tomorrow! But if your like me and probably most people using these apps are, where you need to buy things to progress more, your kinda screwed against those with plenty of money!"
Didn't really like this one first came out but I'm really enjoying it now. I was hoping they would bring out the original dungeon keeper but They didn't do this is a pretty good game.
"Isn't the idea of games that they're meant to be fun or challenging?

Where is the fun on clicking to make a minor upgrade to a room, and then waiting a week for the upgrade to complete? 

Where is the challenge in taking the alternative approach and paying big money to make upgrades?

The original Dungeon Keeper was one of the great computer games. This version is a miserable, venal, travesty of a game."
Can't stand these blights of modern games. It completely and utterly ruins a great game. Who really welcomes them apart from corporate fat cats?
The original dungeon keeper was far superior to the 2nd instalment which E.A helped produce, and then they decided to make this. This monstrosity, if you enjoy playing pay to win games then spend all your money buying rooms and getting pointless upgrades, if you want a real game download the original and fan expansions online, much better than what this is. Also if you want a remake of the original DK The closest we're gonna et is War For The Overworld. Check it out!
Rubbish and complete crap. Crashes often, usually during your attack ending it prematurely and losing the battle and resources. Pathetic attempt to earn as much as possible monies from the in-app purchases. Waste of time.
"This is not a game, this is sitting watching crap graphics and countdown timers. THIS is a sad time for gaming.

This might not be the game everyone expects it to be, as people have pointed out but usually a game evolves from the past games it was named after.

EA could have charged the full £35 that the original Dungeon Keeper game cost and simply have port it across with the added feature of touch screen controls and people would have bought it in the masses.

Instead we end up with yet another pay to win game for mindless zombies to cheat there way through by paying for it, sorry if that offends some people but the whole idea of playing a game is to use skill to win.

Where that is reflex or problem solving, in this the only attributes is who can buy the most gems will win, only possible skill comes from the choice of minions you make and even then the only real skill is once everyone has the same level of progress. 

This is not a game, THIS is a sad time for gaming

And I so hope EA reads this because for a games company as big as EA is, This is not what you used to be about, EA used to be a sign of a high quality product that was highly entertaining and you could say with pride that you bought an EA game without feeling embarrassed. Bring back Electronic Arts, not more Embarrassing Abominations."
I used to love playing this game on the PC. It's a shame they have moved to "in app purchases" as it spoils the game.  Would rather pay for a game than use in app purchases
Thank you so much EA for bringing this game back not exactly like original however its a very addictive game!
Glitch glitch glitch and they won't fix it because no one to talk too!
"It's ok as a game... I don't mind the fact that this is an app which makes you buy gems if you want to speed up however there are serious bugs in this game.
Minions don't go where you place them on campaigns, the game takes a long time to load and then crashes an awful lot resulting in wasted resources. It also eats your battery life on your mobile phone! If the developers could fix these bugs and not make it such a big deal waiting for things to be constructed, it would be a lot better! Please can we get Horny's quips back as in the original series... They just aren't interesting in this one! Thank you"
I really want to love this but the game balance is all wrong.  I would happily pay for a decent game but refuse to pay for IAPs.  It needs to be easier to get gems.
A game that verbally abuses you and is fun to play! What more could you want?
Yes you have to wait ages for things to recharge, which is what "encourages" you to spend money on in-game purchases, but if you're patient and just play it every so often it's still really enjoyable.
Alright
Once again micro transactions have hurt the gaming industry by getting an old classic and then added waiting times to the most basic action. EA could of made more money by porting the old version of dungeon keeper to iOS but no they had to launder money from each little thing you decided to do. The art isn't even original, they have blatantly copied the gems from clash of clans. The one thing I like about this game is the whole fact I get to hit minions.
"You will love it or hate it. I love it. This is the one game I have constantly gone back to. Even joined a guild and made some friends. 
Ok so it's not altogether like the original but perhaps future updates will include a few little Gems to satisfy your need. 
Get it, Try it and dungeon bash away."
Take out micro transactions!
Join my guild everyone is very active ( the brothers in arms ) guild, all are welcome.
Really good MMO, not required to keep coming back every hour of the day even at later levels and it's good to see all the old characters <f0><U+009F><U+0098><U+0080>
Interesting concept. New items should be added at regular intervals to avoid lost of interest. After all, even though this is a good game, it doesn't stop other games for being good, and one only has so much time to spare...
Now I loved the old style games but this one is unique although you wait for upgrades it's still a great game
Although very different from the original pc dungeon keeper games, very enjoyable and brings back memories from childhood.
As much as some people might enjoy waiting for days for anything to happen, I don't. This is utter micro transaction hell. There's potential fun but it is ruined by looooooooong waits for anything, you have the option to use gems to speed everything up but the rate you get them compared to how many you need is ridiculous. Of course you could pay real cash for the gems but I think EA should pay me for the time I've wasted "playing" this sh¡t.
Quite slow at the beginning but fairly entertaining
This game's aim is not the same as the PC DK but nevertheless it is exciting, diverse and endless! Would seriously recommend, far better than Clash of Clans etc. and a lot more addictive!
"Okay, firstly it's not the old PC game - get over it!  Secondly, some of the recent changes have massively improved the 'pay to play' style it launched with. You still need either patience or gems to progress but now it's much easier to earn gems within the game. Personally, I think patience is perfectly acceptable too!

I've been playing this game daily since February (currently 5 months), I've never played a game so much. The player vs. player model is a great challenge and the guild model lets you share the game with other like-minded people.

Give it a go. It may not be for you, but if it is you'll be very glad you found it."
Micro payments are tempting but you can play it without! Very addictive
Ruined an awesome game well and truly. Not to mention the high cost of micro transactions, which I refuse to pay for. EA should admit defeat here and sell the rights on. Disappointed completely, it's a mere shell of what it used to be. Will not be playing again.
Sort out that glitch that randomly decided to quit the game your playing therefore making you loose your win streak!!!!!
"Good game once you get enough attacking force and defences. Good game if your a patient person. I was attacking an online dungeon and In battle suddenly the game froze and said ""imps getting your dungeon in order"" and I was taken back to my home dungeon I lost my 5 victory streak .
I mean what the hell was that. That's BS PLZ FIX!!!!"
Great game to dip in and out of... Providing you have internet coverage!!!
Enjoyed it's slow pace until recently, but for the past week it constantly won't connect and people are saying same thing on their forum. Needs fixing before people lose interest.
The PC version was awesome - this is a joke. I would much rather pay more for a complete working game. Buying gems to fix a slow game model is just a miserable experience. DONT BUY
A good game spoilt by the game crashing every time I try to invade another dungeon. Happened for a long time now, needs fixing. EA just aren't bothered about us customers
The game was slow due to server dependence and speed. Now it never connects even with a wifi connection. No issues with other apps. I'll give it a week then delete if no improvement.
Really good game but long and hard to play if you're not prepared to spend money.
Great fun.
Fantastic game, I spend many of hours on this. We'll worth the download.
"I remember the original on PC and whilst this shares some common DNA it is overall a bit of a mess.  

It crashes all the time, you can only access certain parts of the game if specific events occur, plus the overwhelming reliance on gems in game to speed up the crazy *building* periods is laughable when the only way to obtain enough gems to make a difference is to purchase them in-app for extortionate sums of money.

Avoid!"
It's a good game like.
Could not charge so much for add-ons! If you need them that is.
"Its buggy - spent about 10 times trying to log in. Surprised myself how many times I tried

A big bag of patience required for updates too. Hold your nerve and only use gems when you have to or have deep pockets

I'll play for a bit longer. Fills in the gaps whilst I'm waiting for clash of clans troop builds. If they iron out the bugs it has potential

Update to review : after playing it for a number of months playing:
Great game but it keeps crashing during a raid
Please have some stability"
"The servers for this game are so slow the connection gets lost at most times of the day.
There is little point attempting to reap revenge on an attacker as 80% of the time you get chucked out of the attack with the message ""please wait...""
This adds to the frustration of it taking over a week to upgrade the higher level rooms unless you pay for crystals -I understand capitalism & that people have to be paid, but this is rubbish.
Lastly, yes I was a fan of the old game, yes it was great wish this interpretation wasn't the excriment we have here."
Very good game I am enjoying it a lot.
Great!!
"Despite its poor choice of game design, Dungeon Keeper is still playable. It's fun to build your own dungeon and raid other people's dungeons as well but I wish the game provides single player campaign like the original games. The need to connect online constantly is stupid and makes Dungeon Keeper not portable.

It would also be nice to be able to control your minions during battle. It's annoying when they just wander around aimlessly and get killed so easily.

I also notice that the iPad version is of lower quality than the iPhone/iPod; the lighting and graphics are strangely inferior. Why is that?

Aside from these flaws, Dungeon Keeper is not a bad game. It definitely doesn't come close to the original games but for casual gaming, it's ok."
"Having played the original DK I had high hopes for this one. And the first thirty minutes were promising. However I have a strange feeling that I am on a Ryanair flight... with the constant reminders that you can buy the green gems. Oh how greedy are we, EA...
Going to give this one a chance though as Clash of Clans became a bit easy and boring."
"I have struggled since launch, playing this game without buying any gems.  I have now reached the point whereby it is taking 6days + to upgrade rooms/traps etc.  

I could of course spend £3 and do it instantly, but then I'd only be waiting for the next thing to build, and then the next.

Never have I seen such customer gouging than I have during this game.  I will continue playing the game whilst laughing at those idiots who have plowed real money into this omni-shambles, yet still cant beat my dungeon defences :)"
"I love the gameplay and the aspects of it!
 It's like a version of clash of clans which I also love! 
 Some game play a little messy, like if you click a house it goes to upgrade option instead of you clicking upgrade then pay for it,
 Things do take time but I'm into this kinda game so I think it's great! Tidy things up and it's perfect"
Amazing
Love the dungeon keeper series on the PC and this makes it even better due to the graphics and of course all the little things horny says.... Gives the game another side to the comedy.
The time wait is effed but other wise it's okay
Not like the PC game but enjoyable all the same. Having to pay cash for imps is annoying.
Great gameplay and the fact you get gems from raids is amazing
I downloaded this on my iPad and it hasn't been able to load no matter what I do. I've re-installed it, turned my iPad off and on again, and updated my software. Still no joy, it loads a little then kicks me out to the home screen. I couldn't believe my luck when I found this and it turns out I can't even play the stupid thing! I've gone on the FAQ bits and the app support but nothing's helped. I give up!
Love it! I few bugs need fixing but apart from that brill
"First off, join my guild (Nuck futz) !! :-)Good game, but for defence purposes, it would be nice to be able to destroy your own buildings if you want to.

For example, mines! At the start you just want to unlock more mines,.. Later on you realise that the more you have, the harder it is to defend... It would be nice to be able to abandon them if you want to."
I've been playing this now from release, and I have to say it will never compare to the originals. However looking past that it is slowly changing for the better. It no longer takes a whole day to dig one block up! Now it only takes twelve hours!! The AI in battles is stupid and hardly works. And the cost of items and rooms is still far to expensive.
Love it
Having put 70 consecutive days of effort and waiting to finally have a decent dungeon, I haven't been able to connect in 5 days. Nowhere near as good as Bullfrog's original games but still good, despite the rip-off IAP prices and poor connection
I spent 3 million stone on an upgrade and it crashed I turned it back on and all my stone was gone and the upgrade stopped. This has happened several times!
Addictive I must say
"I don't get ""into"" app games much, but this one has sunk its claws in. It needn't cost you anything either, with a points system and balance that rewards the long-term gamers as much as the short term ones with money to burn. 

If you're looking for a guild to join, then look up 'London'! We're recruiting."
Really enjoy this app it's entertaining
......it takes far too long to load once pressed.  Also if not used for a couple of minutes you have to wait the same time again.
AN APPALLING GAME, DISGUSTING USE OF A LOVED FRANCHISE, A SHAMEFUL ATTEMPT TO STEAL YOUR MONEY
Nice game good to build your own dungeon
Really enjoyed this updated version.
"How do you take what was a fantastic, humorous, enjoyable game back in the day & turn it into something that lacks all of the above.
Let E.A remake it as a money sucking abomination. The premise is almost the same as the original but the execution is hideous.
Building your dungeon quickly becomes an exercise in waiting days for things to happen or alternatively just use gems which you can collect very slowly or or just Pay to Win.
Why E.A couldn't have just remade the original is the real question as I'm sure like me many people would have paid a reasonable price for it.
Poor show once again E.A."
"Just written a huge constructive review only to be told the nickname has been taken so I've lost everything I typed.
I shall just sum up this game in a few words, instead.
If you want to be totally fleeced of real life cash from EA for a product that is totally imbalanced and takes days to build anything in real time,  without spending huge amounts of real life  cash, then this game is totally for you.
IF there is anyone on the EA team left from BULLFROG then I would be seriously surprised.
